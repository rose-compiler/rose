 * Note that name collisions are common when functions are defined in .h files.  Just insert anyway.
 *
 * \param[in] inCache : This is the "cache" that was just read from a json file and is to be merged in

/**
 * Evaluates each FunctionRecord recursively, that is, it also gets the 
 * maxGlobality and maxAccessType from each calledFunction.
 * 
 * This is performed recursively, so THREE caches are involved:
 *   1. startCache: The cache read from the input files and combined.  It is assumed to have come from files 
 *                  where the files were processed individually and the accessRecords have been evaluated, 
 *                  but functions have not.
 *   2. completedCache : This contains functions that HAVE been processed.  This is to avoid unecessary work.
 *   3. workingCache: This is passed in and should only contain functions that are currently being processed.
 *                    This is avoid infinite recursion.  The working cache functions aren't complete, but if 
 *                    we see a function in here, we know we can stop recursing. 
 *
 * \param[record] The function we are evaluating (calledFunctions will be recursed into)
 * \param[out] maxGlobality  : Expected to be 0 during the initial call!
 * \param[out] maxVarType : Expected to be 0 during the initial call!
 * \param[out] maxAccessType : Expected to be 0 during the initial call!
 * \param[in] ignoreFunctions : Functions to ignore when it comes to RWSets because they have issue that are known to not be enlightening.
 *                              (Example, ... like printLog are UNKNOWN, but don't affect the caller)
 * \param[inout] localPtrFuncs : Functions that access a local pointer, inside this function we will add functions that call a
 *                               function that access a local pointer 
 * \param[inout] workingCache: The set of functions seen so far during this recursion, so we don't infinitely loop
