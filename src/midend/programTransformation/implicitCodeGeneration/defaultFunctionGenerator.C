Goal:
  Insert default compiler-generated class constructors, destructor,
  copy constructor, assignment operator into AST
  if they are called somewhere and not defined by users.

Divide and Conquer:

* judge if a class constructor(and others) is needed or not(= invoked or not)
    find all constructor call sites( SgConstructorInitializer  ?)

* judge if a constructor,etc exists or not, 
   Must traverse from the call site to the class declaration site
   lookup all member functions for a constructor

  Note: Since a copy constructor might be also tagged as a constructor,
  A 'lazy' compiler may treat it as a constructor and stop generating
  default constructor once it sees a copy constructor.

  A 'diligent' compiler will check both constructor name and argument list
  to decide if it is necessary to generate a default constructor, even if
  a user-defined copy constructor already exists. 

  I use the lazy policy here since both GCC and Intel seem lazy in this case. 

* create default member functions in the form of AST subtree
    refer to a full AST with a constructor etc. to see what nodes and edges are needed
      SgMemberFunctionType, SgFunctionDefinition,SgFunctionParameterList
    Must set special function modifier to isConstructor 

** generated both declaration and definition when applicable(copy constructor&operator=)

** mark it as compiler generated/transformation generated

** insert it into the right place,and build connections:

Todo:
   consider inheritance case

Here is a summary of what I (Brian) believe to be the behavior of 
compiler-generated default and copy constructors, destructors, and 
operator=.  References are to Stroustrup's 3rd edition, except section 
r.12.8 which is in the 2nd edition.  I could not track this down in the 
3rd edition.  
 
3rd edition Section 12.2.2 states: 
 
"Default constructors can be invoked implicitly.  However, if all 
constructors for a base require arguments, then a constructor for that 
base must be explicitly called." 
 
-> Default constructors can be implicitly invoked by user-defined 
constructors. 
 
3rd Section 12.2.3 about operator= does not state that it is implicitly 
invoked.  Therefore, and buttressed by your extended example below, it 
seems C++ does not implicitly invoke operator=. 
 
-> operator= and copy constructor are not implicitly invoked by 
user-defined methods, but ... 
 
2nd Edition r.12.8 (Copying Class Objects) states that if the assignment 
operator and copy constructor are "not defined by the programmer, they 
will be defined as memberwise assignment and memberwise initialization of 
the members of X, respectively." 
 
-> The compiler will generate operator= and copy constructor if not 
defined by the user. 
 
And: "Memberwise assignment and memberwise initialization implies that if 
a class X has a member of a class M, M's assignment operator and M's copy 
constructor are used to implement assignment and initialization of the 
member, respectively." 
 
-> Compiler-generated operator= and copy constructors will implicitly 
invoke compiler-generated or user-defined operator= and copy constructors. 
 
3rd Edition Section 10.4.2 talks about default constructors: 

"A default constructor is a constructor that can be called without 
supplying an argument [so it can have default args] ... If a user has 
declared a default constructor, that one will be used; otherwise, the 
compiler will try to generate one if needed and if the user HASN'T 
DECLARED other constructors." 
 
-> The compiler will generate a default constructor if there are no other 
user-defined constructors.

    Subject: Re: problems with constructor initializers
    
    
    Dan,
    
    You're right-- it is possible to distinguish whether a default or copy
    constructor should be invoked.  This e-mail gives examples that show how
    to do that.  Once I have hand this back to you the
    defaultFunctionGenerator should be doing everything necessary to
    facilitate the "fixing up" of constructor calls such that they do not have
    NULL SgConstructorInitializers.  That is, given the templates below you
    should be able to distinguish between the cases, look up the methods
    generated by defaultFunctionGenerator, and attach references to them as
    necessary.  In each case I've given my opinion of what needs to be done to
    normalize the calls.
    
    Here is an example program:
    
    class FooBar
    {
     public:
    };
    
    int main()
    {
      FooBar fb;                       // case 1
      FooBar fb2(fb);                  // case 2
    
      FooBar *fb3 = new FooBar();      // case 3
      FooBar *fb4 = new FooBar(*fb3);  // case 4
    
      return 0;
    
    }
    
    I have attached the dot output so you can see what is going on.
    
    Here is a breakdown of the 4 cases, not all of which can be inferred from
    the dot output.
    
    case 1:  FooBar fb;
    
    The SgInitializedName has type FooBar.
    The initializer is NULL.
    
    This is the distinguishing signature of an invocation of a default
    constructor (for a stack variable).
    
    To normalize:  Add a SgConstructorInitializer from the SgInitializedName
    which points to the default constructor for FooBar which
    defaultFunctionGEnerator will create.
    
    case 2:  FooBar fb2(fb);
    
    The SgInitializedName has type FooBar.
    The initializer is a SgAssignInitializer, whose operand is "fb" with type
    FooBar.
    
    This is the signature of a copy constructor invoked for a stack variable.
    
    To normalize:  Change the SgInitializedName's initializer from a
    SgAssignInitializer to a SgConstructorInitializer.  Make this constructor
    initializer point to the copy constructor created by
    defaultFunctionGenerator.
    
    case 3:  FooBar *fb3 = new FooBar();
    
    The SgInitializedName has type FooBar*.
    The initializer is a SgAssignInitializer, whose operand is a SgNewExp with
    a NULL SgConstructorInitializer (via get_constructor_args).  The built_in
    args is NULL.
    
    This is the signature of a default constructor invoked for new.
    
    To normalize:  Make the SgNewExp's
    get_constructor_args/SgConstructorIntializer point to the default
    constructor created by defaultFunctionGenerator.
    
    case 4:  FooBar *fb4 = new FooBar(*fb3);
    
    The SgInitializedName has type FooBar*.
    The initializer is a SgAssignInitializer, whose operand is a SgNewExp with
    a NULL SgConstructorInitializer (via get_constructor_args).  The built_in
    args has a single expression (for *fb3).
    
    This is the signature of a copy constructor invoked via new.
    
    To normalize:  Make the SgNewExp's
    get_constructor_args/SgConstructorIntializer point to the copy
    constructor created by defaultFunctionGenerator.
    
    Thanks,
    Brian

/***
 * KNOWN ISSUES (bwhite 6/21/06 as of rev 0.2)
 *
 * 1.  Need to introduce destructor calls where they would be
 *     called implicitly.  Currently, we only introduce destructor
 *     calls, i.e., this->~Foo(), within a destructor Bar, where
 *     Foo is a base class of Bar.
 *
 * 2.  Need to fix constructor calls in which the constructor
 *     may be inferred, but is not directly specified.  In cases
 *     in which the constructor had not been defined (prior to
 *     running this traversal) but was invoked, SAGE might not
 *     have a method declaration to use at the call site.  In such
 *     cases, the method dangling from a SgConstructorInitializer
 *     might be NULL (e.g., if it represents a call to a default
 *     constructor) or where we would expect a SgConstructorInitializer
 *     we instead see a SgAssignInitializer (e.g., if it represents
 *     a call to the copy constructor).  Please see the above
 *     note on 'inferring which constructor is invoked' above.
 *
 *     NB:  We have introduced calls to all special methods
 *          where they were implicit (except for destructor calls
 *          as noted in (1) ).  These calls are different:
 *          there _are_ explicit calls, but they do not directly
 *          name the invoked special method.
 *
 * 3.  Where invocations of special methods are introduced, they
 *     are not necessarily introduced in the proper order.
 *     The procedure for introducing implicit methods is as follows
 *     (please see generateImplicitInvocations).  For a given
 *     special method C::m, we determine all superclasses C' of C.
 *     We then determine all base classes C'' invoked within C::m.
 *     Roughly, this means any method C''::m invoked from C::m.
 *     Note however that if m were a copy constructor, then we would
 *     also collect any class C'' whose _default_ constructor was
 *     invoked.  Now, for all superclasses C' of C (visited in
 *     order as returned from get_inheritances()), if C' is not in
 *     C'', we generate a method call.  Presumably, methods are
 *     supposed to be called according to some special order,
 *     e.g., the order in which their base classes are listed in
 *     the inheriting class' definition.
 *
 * 4.  There is no special provisioning for virtual base classes.
 *     Should there be?  I think so.  For example,
 *
 *     class A { };
 *     class B : public virtual A { };
 *     class C : public virtual A, public virtual B { };
 *
 *     ...
 * 
 *     C c;   // invokes C's default constructor.
 *
 *     The invocation of C's default constructor should only invoke
 *     A's default constructor once.  Currently, we will make the
 *     following definitions:
 *
 *     C::C() : A(), B() { }
 *     B::B() : A() { }
 *     A::A() { }
 *
 *     Thus, when C is invoked, we call A::A() twice.  Instead,
 *     we should have created:
 *
 *     C::C() : B() { }   // no call to A() here, since we get in 
 *                        // from B()
 *     B::B() : A() { }
 *     A::A() { }
 *
 * 5.  We generate ambiguous code due to multiple heritance
 *     of the same base class, which will not compile.  I do not
 *     believe this is a problem because this generated code will
 *     not be emitted by the unparser and should not confuse analyses.

    Subject: ambiguities due to multiple inheritance
    
    
    Hi Dan,
    
    I've run across an issue this morning in introducing implicit
    constructor calls under multiple inheritance.  Briefly:  doing the obvious
    thing (introducing a call for each direct base class) can produce
    ambiguous code which some compilers will reject.  I believe this is _not_
    a problem because we won't actually pass this code to the backend and I
    can't see any reason why analyses should get confused.  Could you verify
    my suspicion that the approach desribed below is OK, although it would
    introduce bad code if we actually compiled it.
    
    [I would have called, but I thought it easier to communicate the example
    over e-mail.]
    
    Here is my simple example:
    
    #include <iostream>
    
    class A {
     public:
      A() { std::cout << "A" << std::endl; };
    };
    class B: public A { };
    class C: public A, public B {
     public:
      C() : A() {
        std::cout << "C" << std::endl;
      }
    };
    
    int main()
    {
      C c;
      return 0;
    }
    
    The point is:  C inherits from A and B and B inherits from A.  [None of
    this inheritance is virtual.]  Therefore, C has two copies of A (or two
    routes to A if I had used virtual inheritance).  Therefore, the invocation
    of A() in C() is ambigous, though I would have expected it to refer to C's
    direct base class A.
    
    Notice two things:
    
    1.  I expect the invocation of C(), as in 'C c;', to invoke A's
    constructor twice and C's once.
    
    2.  If C() had been defined as:
    
      C() {
        std::cout << "C" << std::endl;
      }
    
    i.e., where the call to A() is implicit, our translator would have
    generated the above (first) definition of C() in which this implicit
    invocation was made explicit.  [We would have also added an explicit call
    to B().]
    
    This code does not compile on tux using g++ 3.3.3:
    
    [bwhite@tux83 default-function-translator]$ g++ -o example example.C
    example.C:8: warning: direct base `A' inaccessible in `C' due to ambiguity
    example.C: In constructor `C::C()':
    example.C:10: error: `A' is an ambiguous base of `C'
    example.C:10: error: type `class A' is not a direct base of `C'
    
    It does compile on my laptop using g++ 2.95.3:
    
    localbwhite@dhcp-bwhite:~> g++ -o example example.C ; ./example
    example.C:13: warning: direct base `A' inaccessible in `C' due to
    ambiguity
    A
    A
    C
    
    Notice it invokes the constructors as I expected it should.
    
    The default-function translator marks nodes as either compiler-generated
    or as transformation nodes:
    
    #define COMPILERGENERATED_FILE_INFO
    Sg_File_Info::generateDefaultFileInfoForTransformationNode()
    //#define COMPILERGENERATED_FILE_INFO
    Sg_File_Info::generateDefaultFileInfoForCompilerGeneratedNode()
    
    The first define is useful for debugging (so that we can verify we are
    doing the right thing), but the second define is how we will actually use
    this translator.  Thus, any code we introduce will not be passed to the
    backend compiler (if we use the second define).  Therefore, I don't have
    to be concerned that this code which the translator will add to the AST:
    
      C() : A() {
        std::cout << "C" << std::endl;
      }
    
    may or may not compile.  Do you agree?
    
    Thanks,
    Brian

    Subject: Re: ambiguities due to multiple inheritance
    
    Hi Brian,
        You can put them into the constructor body, as shown below,
    but that is not a great solution.  Instead you might just go
    ahead and place them into the constructor's preinitialization list
    but mark them as compiler generated AND mark them as not to be
    output in the generated code (this may not apply to expressions
    currently, and in fact I have identified a ROSE bug when the
    default constructor is specified (as below)).
    
        This might be a subject to discuss, I not sure that this
    is as easy as I expected it to be if you plan to unparse and
    compile the normalized code (for the reasons that you noted).
    
    Thanks,
    Dan

//               Thus they only exist in the AST for analysis purposes,
//               which is our intent.  There are a few reasons for doing this:
//               1.  We don't want to confuse the user by introducing
//                   code which isn't in the original program.
//               2.  We introduce definitions a bit liberally.  e.g.,
//                   we always provide a default constructor if one does
//                   not exist.  This is not consistent with the C++
//                   language definition, which states that a compiler
//                   should only introduce a definition "if needed"
//                   (i.e., invoked).
//               3.  (and most importantly)  Some of the source code
//                   we introduce will not compile.  In particular,
//                   in the face of multiple inheritance of the same
//                   base class, we may introduce ambiguous constructor
//                   calls.  These should not confuse analysis, but may
//                   upset the backend compiler.  Please seee the
//                   comment above regarding "multiple inheritance"
//                   under "known issues".

// Set this to false to mark new nodes as transformation nodes,
// rather than compiler-generated nodes.  The former will be unparsed,
// the latter will not.

 *  If the method is a constructor, destructor, or operator=, 
 *  other copy or default constructors, destructors, or operator=
 *  methods may be implicitly invoked from it.  Please see
 *  the discussion at the top of this file.
 *
 *  Let the method's "flavor" describe whether it is a 
 *  constructor, destructor, or operator=.  generateImplicitInvocations
 *  finds any _explicit_ invocations within the method of a
 *  method of the same flavor invoked on one of its base classes.
 *  It then iterates over each of base class and records
 *  which of these had a method (of the same flavor) invoked upon it.
 *  Those which did not will have their method implicitly invoked.
 *  The task of generateImplicitInvocations is to make these
 *  implicit invocations explicit by creating the necessary
 *  AST nodes.
 *
 *  For each base class which has not been invoked, we look up 
 *  the method of the correct flavor in that base class and create
 *  an invocation of it.  If that method does not exist, it would
 *  be automatically generated by the backend compiler.  Therefore,
 *  we generate the method definition here.
 *  
 *  NB:  The generated order of invocation is probably not correct.
 *  I imagine C++ dictates the order in which constructors, destructors,
 *  etc. are invoked on base classes.  Instead, I just iterate
 *  over the base classes and invoke methods in that order (modulo
 *  those base classes which have already been invoked).  At the
 *  bare minimum the ordering of implicit invocations should probably
 *  be interleaved with existing explicit invocations (in some way).
 *
 *  NB:  Assuming that a base class is only registered once in
 *  get_inheritances, we should only invoke a constructor, destructor, etc.
 *  once per base class.  Is this the correct behavior with respect
 *  to multiple inheritance?  How about multiple inheritance when the
 *  base class is virtual.

              Subject: constructor normalization: introducing name qualifiers
              
              
              Hi Dan,
              
              I've made implicit calls to operator= explicit:
              
                FooBar &operator=(const class FooBar &rhs)
              {
                  (*(this))=rhs;
              
              Unfortunately, this will result in infinite recursion.  The operator= I
              introduced is actually Foo::operator=, where Foo is the base class of
              FooBar.  How can I force the unparser to qualify operator=:
              
               FooBar &operator=(const class FooBar &rhs)
              {
                  this->Foo::operator=(rhs);
              
              [I think that is the correct syntax.]
              
              I am currently creating the SgMemberFunctionRefExp as:
              
                      SgMemberFunctionRefExp *fr =
                         new SgMemberFunctionRefExp(COMPILERGENERATED_FILE_INFO, f, 0,
              functype, 0);
                      fr->set_need_qualifier(false);
              
              i.e., the last need_qualifier arg to the constructor is false.  I then
              explicitly set need_qualifier to false.  Presumably, this is redundant.
              If I set these to true, I get:
              
                FooBar &operator=(const class FooBar &rhs)
              {
                  =rhs;
              
              I suppose I could cast rhs to be of type Foo, so that I wouldn't need it
              to be qualified.  i.e.,
              
                FooBar &operator=(const class FooBar &rhs)
              {
                  (*(this))= (Foo&)rhs;
              
              should invoke Foo::operator=.  Is this the preferred method?
              
              Thanks,
              Brian

              Hi Brian,
                  I think you may have to do it the last
              way, you have come up against a bug reported
              by Andreas and I that I have not fixed.  I
              tried a few months ago, and it was much harder
              than I expected, so I backed off and I have not
              returned to it.
