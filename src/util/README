This directory contains sets of code required for ROSE
but which may be specific to specific features in ROSE.


support directory: Contains work required for Qing Yi's 
    loop optimization work in ROSE.  External users should
    not use these functions.  In some cases they are 
    redundant with ROSE mechansims that are documented
    and intended for external users.

stringSupport: Contians general support functions for dealing 
    with strings (both std::string and C style char* strings).
    There is am emphasis in phasing out all use of C style char* 
    strings in ROSE, but this is an ongoing process (though finished
    within the ROSE API).

commandlineProcessing: This is the support in ROSE for commandline 
    handling.  This is documented in the ROSE Tutorial and is
    intended for external users to use in there ROSE based translators.

graphs: This is a graph library from Qing Yi's work which is not 
    documented and many people have had trouble using.  Although
    used in Qing's work it is not clear if it should be used by external 
    users.

Sawyer: event logging, runtime logic assertions, etc.
