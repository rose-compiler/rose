/** Holds a set of registers without regard for register boundaries.
 *
 *  This class is a container to which registers can be inserted and erased in such a way that the boundaries of registers are
 *  irrelevant. For instance, if one constructs an empty container, then inserts the 16-bit x86 AX register, then removes the
 *  8-bit AH register (the high order eight bits of AX) all that's left is AL (the low-order 8 bits).
 *
 *  Sometimes this container contains parts of registers that don't correpond to actual named registers for the machine.  For
 *  instance, if we insert the x86 EFLAGS register and then erase the ZF bit flag we're left with two parts of EFLAGS that
 *  don't actually have names in the x86 documentation.  However, we can query whether another bit flag, say NF, is still
 *  present (which it is in this example).
 *
 *  One way to figure out names for the parts contained here is to get a list of all registers from a register dictionary, then
 *  query whether each is fully present in this container, report its name if present, and then remove its part from this
 *  container. If the container is non-empty at the end then all that can be done is to report which parts are still present. */
