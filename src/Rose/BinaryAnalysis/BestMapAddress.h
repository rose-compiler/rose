/** Finds best address for mapping code.
 *
 *  This analysis looks at function addresses and function calls to create two lists of addresses: entry addresses and target
 *  addresses, respectively. Only function calls using absolute addressing are considered. It then calculates how much the set
 *  of entry addresses should be shifted up or down in memory in order to best line up with target addresses.  The assumption
 *  is that most of the function calls found by disassembling refer to functions that were also disassembled, and that by
 *  shifting the entire executable to higher or lower addresses we can get these to match up. */
