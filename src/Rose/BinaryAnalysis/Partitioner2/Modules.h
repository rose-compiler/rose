/** Base class for adjusting basic blocks during discovery.
 *
 *  User-defined basic block callbacks are invoked as each instruction is discovered for a basic block. See @ref
 *  Partitioner::discoverBasicBlock for details.
 *
 *  One of the important uses for basic block callbacks is to adjust the control flow successors for a basic block.  As each
 *  instruction of a basic block is discovered the partitioner calculates its control flow successors to decide what to do.
 *  The successors are calculated by evaluating the basic block instructions in a symbolic domain, and if that fails, by
 *  looking at the final instruction's concrete successors.  Once these successors are obtained, the partitioner invokes user
 *  callbacks so that the user has a chance to make adjustments. By time this callback is invoked, the basic block's initial
 *  successors have been computed and cached in the basic block. That list can be obtained by invoking @ref
 *  Partitioner::basicBlockSuccessors (or similar) or by accessing the @ref BasicBlock::successors cache directly. Likewise,
 *  the successor list can be adjusted by invoking methods in the partitioner API or by modifying the cache directly.
 *
 *  Another important use for these callbacks is to tell the partitioner when a basic block is finished.  The partitioner has a
 *  fairly long list of criteria that it uses as documented in @ref Partitioner::discoverBasicBlock.  One of these criteria is to
 *  look at the `args.results.termination` enum returned by the callbacks: if it is TERMINATE_NOW or TERMINATE_PRIOR then the block
 *  is forcibly terminated regardless of what would have otherwise happened.
 *
 *  The partitioner expects callbacks to have shared ownership (see @ref heap_object_shared_ownership) and references them only
 *  via @ref Sawyer::SharedPointer.  Therefore, subclasses should implement an @c instance class method that allocates a new
 *  object and returns a shared pointer. */

 *  pass attempts to assign the best definitions. It does so by first ranking the definitions according to how often they match
 *  across all the functions known to the partitioner. Then, for each function in the specified @p ast, the we also get a
 *  list matching definitions (if a calling convention analysis has been run on that function). We copy into the AST that
