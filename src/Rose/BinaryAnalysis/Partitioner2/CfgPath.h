 *  the @p pathsCallSite in the paths graph and provides information about which functions are called.
 *
 *  There are two similar functions: one inlines all the functions called from a particular call site in the CFG, the other
 *  inlines one specific function specified by its entry vertex.  In the latter case, the CFG doesn't actually need to have an
 *  edge to the called function.
 *
 *  Usually, @p cfgCallSite has one outgoing @ref E_FUNCTION_CALL edge and @p pathsCallSite (and @p cfgCallSite) has one
 *  outgoing @ref E_CALL_RETURN edge. If the @p pathsCallSite has no @ref E_CALL_RETURN edge, or the called function has no
 *  return sites, this operation is a no-op.  A call site may call multiple functions, in which case each is inserted, even if
 *  some @ref E_FUNCTION_CALL edges point to the same function.  A called function may return to multiple addresses, such as
 *  longjmp, in which case multiple @ref E_CALL_RETURN edges may be present--all return sites are linked to all return targets
 *  by this operation.
 *
 *  The vertices and edges in the inlined version that correspond to the @p cfgAvoidEVertices and @p cfgAvoidEdges are not
 *  copied into the @p paths graph. If this results in the called function having no paths that can return, then that
 *  function is not inserted into @p paths.
 *
 *  The @ref E_CALL_RETURN edges in @p paths are not erased by this operation, but are usually subsequently erased by the
 *  user since they are redundant after this insertion--they represent a short-circuit over the called function(s).
 *
 *  Returns true if some function was inserted, false if no changes were made to @p paths.  If @p newVertices is non-null then
