/** Partitions instructions into basic blocks and functions.
 *
 *  A partitioner is responsible for driving a disassembler to obtain instructions, grouping those instructions into basic
 *  blocks, grouping the basic blocks into functions, and building an abstract syntax tree. The partitioner is the low-level
 *  part of the whole partitioning process (the @ref Engine is the high-level part) and is customized by registering
 *  callbacks.  The partitioner knows "how" to group small components (like instructions) into larger components (like basic
 *  blocks) whereas the engine knows "where" to look for things in the specimen address space.
 *
 *  The following objects are needed as input:
 *
 * @li A memory map containing the memory for the specimen being analyzed.  Parts of memory that contain instructions must be
 *     mapped with execute permission.  Parts of memory that are readable and non-writable will be considered constant for the
 *     purpose of disassembly and partitioning and can contain things like dynamic linking tables that have been initialized
 *     prior to calling the partitioner.  The memory map need not be the exact memory map for the specimen, and often isn't,
 *     because the specimen's mapping permissions might not be appropriate.
 *
 * @li A disassembler which is canonical for the specimen architecture and which will return an instruction (possibly an
 *     "unknown" instruction) whenever it is asked to disassemble an address that is mapped with execute permission.  The
 *     partitioner wraps the disassembler and memory map into an @ref InstructionProvider that caches disassembled
 *     instructions.
 *
 *  The following data structures are maintained consistently by the partitioner (described in detail later):
 *
 *  @li A control flow graph (CFG) indicating the basic blocks that will become part of the final abstract syntax tree (AST).
 *      The CFG is highly fluid during partitioning, with basic blocks and control flow edges being added and removed.  Since
 *      basic blocks are composed of instructions, the CFG indirectly represents the instructions that will become the AST.
 *
 *  @li An address usage map (AUM), which is a mapping from every address represented in the CFG to the instruction(s) and
 *      their basic blocks.  A single address may have multiple overlapping instructions (although this isn't the usual case),
 *      and every instruction represented by the map belongs to exactly one basic block that belongs to the CFG.
 *
 * @section partitoner_basic_block Basic Blocks
 *
 *  A basic block (BB) is a sequence of distinct instructions that are always executed linearly from beginning to end with no
 *  branching into or out of the middle of the BB.  The semantics of a BB are the composition of the semantics of each
 *  instruction in the order they would be executed.  The instructions of a BB are not required to be contiguous in memory,
 *  although they usually are.
 *
 *  A basic block has a starting address (equivalent to the starting address of its first instruction when its first
 *  instruction is known), and a size measured in instructions.  A basic block's size in bytes is generally not useful since
 *  there is no requirement that the instructions be contiguous in memory.  Basic blocks also store the results of various
 *  analyses that are run when the block is created.
 *
 *  Basic blocks can either be represented in a partitioner's CFG/AUM, or they can exist in a detached state.  Basic blocks in
 *  a detached state can be modified directly via BasicBlock methods, but blocks that are attached to the CFG/AUM are
 *  frozen. Frozen blocks can still be modified in certain ways, but usually only by going through the Partitioner API that
 *  ensures that the CFG/AUM are kept up-to-date.  The CFG/AUM will contain at most one basic block per basic block starting
 *  address.
 *
 *  If the first instruction of a basic block is unmapped or mapped without execute permission then the basic block is said to
 *  be non-existing and will have no instructions.  Such blocks point to the special "nonexisting" CFG vertex when they are
 *  attached to the control flow graph. If a non-initial instruction of a basic block is unmapped or not executable then the
 *  prior instruction becomes the final instruction of the block and the block's successor will be a vertex for a non-existing
 *  basic block which in turn points to the special "nonexisting" CFG vertex.  In other words, a basic block will either
 *  entirely exist or entirely not exist (there are no basic blocks containing instructions that just run off the end of
 *  memory).
 *
 *  If a basic block encounters an address which is mapped with execute permission and properly aligned but the instruction
 *  provider is unable to disassemble an instruction at that address, then the instruction provider must provide an "unknown"
 *  instruction. Since an "unknown" instruction always has indeterminate edges it becomes the final instruction of the basic
 *  block, and the CFG will contain an edge to the special "indeterminate" vertex.  Blocks that have improper alignment are
 *  treated as if they started at an unmapped or non-executable address.
 *
 * @section partitioner_data_block Data Blocks
 *
 *  A data block is an address and data type anywhere in memory.  A data block can be attached to a CFG/AUM, or exist in a
 *  detached state. They are attached to the CFG/AUM by virtue of being owned by one or more basic blocks or functions that are
 *  attached to the CFG/AUM. Data blocks such as function alignment are typically attached to a function, while data blocks
 *  such as branch tables are typically attached to a basic block.  A data block may be attached to more than one function
 *  and/or basic block, and the CFG/AUM is able to support multiple data blocks having the same address.
 *
 * @section partitioner_functions Functions
 *
 *  A function is a collection of one or more basic blocks related by control flow edges.  One basic block is special in that
 *  it serves as the only entry point to this function for inter-function edges (usually function calls).  Any edge that leaves
 *  the function must enter a different function's entry block.  These two rules can be relaxed, but result in a control flow
 *  graph that is not proper for a function--most of ROSE's analyses work only on proper control flow graphs.
 *
 *  Functions can either be represented in a partitioner's CFG/AUM, or they can exist in a detached state.  Functions in a
 *  detached state can have their basic block and data block ownership adjusted, otherwise the function exists in a frozen
 *  state to prevent the CFG/AUM from becoming out of date with respect to the function.  Frozen functions can only be modified
 *  through the Partitioner API so that the CFG/AUM can be updated.  When a function becomes detached from the CFG it thaws out
 *  again and can be modified.  The CFG/AUM will contain at most one function per function starting address.
 *
 * @section partitioner_cfg Control Flow Graph
 *
 *  At any point in time, the partitioner's control flow graph represents those basic blocks (and indirectly the instructions)
 *  that have been selected to appear in the final abstract syntax tree (AST).  This is a subset of all basic blocks ever
 *  created, and a subset of the instructions known to the instruction provider. Note: a final pass during AST construction
 *  might join certain CFG vertices into a single SgAsmBlock under certain circumstances.  The CFG is of type @ref
 *  ControlFlowGraph, a subset of @ref Sawyer::Container::Graph whose vertices and edges both carry information: the vertices
 *  are of type @ref CfgVertex and the edges are of type @ref CfgEdge.
 *
 *  Most CFG vertices represent basic blocks (vertex type @ref V_BASIC_BLOCK) and either point to a non-null @ref BasicBlock
 *  having at least one discovered instruction, or to a null basic block.  A "placeholder" usually refers to a vertex with a
 *  null basic block pointer (but not necessarily), and "basic block" refers to a vertex with a non-null pointer. Therefore the
 *  set of placeholders is a superset of the set of basic blocks.  A "pure placeholder" is a basic block vertex with a null
 *  pointer. Any of the @ref V_BASIC_BLOCK vertices can also point to an optional function that owns the block.
 *
 *  Placeholders with null basic block pointers represent one of two situations: either the partitioner has not attempted to
 *  discover an instruction at the basic block starting address, or the partitioner has tried but failed due to the address
 *  being non-executable or not mapped.  The two cases are distinguished from each other by whether the vertex's only outgoing
 *  edge points to the special "undiscovered" or "nonexisting" vertex.  Pure placeholders always have exactly this one outgoing
 *  edge.
 *
 *  The CFG also has other special (non-basic block) vertices each represented by its own vertex type. Altogether, the special
 *  vertices, by their type, are:
 *
 *  @li @c VertexType::V_UNDISCOVERED: a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges originate only from pure placeholders, one edge
 *      per placeholder. This vertex is returned by @ref undiscoveredVertex and users can use its incoming edge list as a simple
 *      work-list of places where instructions need to be discovered.
 *
 *  @li @c VertexType::V_NONEXISTING: a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges originate from pure placeholders that were
 *      discovered to have an unmapped or non-executable starting address, one edge per placeholder.  In other words, this vertex's
 *      incoming edges point back to addresses where the partitioner thinks there should be a basic block but there isn't. An
 *      example is entry addresses for dynamically linked functions that have not been loaded and linked. This vertex is returned by
 *      @ref nonexistingVertex.
 *
 *  @li @c VertexType::V_INDETERMINATE: a unique, special vertex that serves as the destination for any basic block outgoing edge
 *      whose target address is not concrete.  For instance, an indirect jump through a register whose value is not known will have
 *      an edge to the indeterminate vertex.  An "unknown" instruction, which indicates that memory is executable but disassembly
 *      failed, also always point to the indeterminate vertex. This vertex is returned by @ref indeterminateVertex.
 *
 *  CFG edges are also labeled with type information:
 *
 *  @li @c EdgeType::E_FUNCTION_CALL: represents an edge known to be a function call. A function call is defined as an
 *      inter-function branch that pushes a return address onto the stack.
 *
 *  @li @c EdgeType::E_FUNCTION_XFER: represents an inter-function edge which is not a function call.  These edges represent a
 *      transfer of control from the caller to the callee (even though there is no CALL instruction) where the callee inherits the
 *      stack frame of the caller.  When the callee returns it will skip over the caller because the caller does not have a distinct
 *      stack frame.  An example is an edge from a thunk consisting of an indirect jump instruction that branches to another
 *      function.
 *
 *  @li @c EdgeType::E_FUNCTION_RETURN: represents a function return-to-caller, such as from a RET instruction.  If a function can
 *      return to multiple locations, rather than store a list edges for each possible return address, the CFG stores only one edge
 *      with an abstract value, thus pointing to the indeterminate vertex. Of course if a function can only return to one address
 *      then the edge is concrete and points to a placeholder at that address, but how often does that happen?
 *
 *  @li @c EdgeType::E_CALL_RETURN: represents a function return with respect to a call site.  These edges normally originate at
 *      CALL instructions and point to the address following the call.  Lack of such an edge when the CFG is finished usually
 *      indicates that the called function cannot return.
 *
 *  @li @c EdgeType::E_NORMAL: represents any edge not in one of the above categories.
 *
 * @section partitioner_aum Address Usage Map
 *
 *  The address usage map (AUM) is similar to the control flow graph in that they both represent the same set of instructions,
 *  basic blocks, and functions. But where the CFG organizes them according to their control flow relationships, the AUM
 *  organizes them by the memory addresses they occupy.  The partitioner ensures that both data structures are always
 *  synchronized with each other from the perspective of an outside viewer (including user callbacks).
 *
 *  The AUM can answer queries about what instructions, basic blocks, data blocks, or functions are contained within, begin
 *  within, span, or overlap an address or address interval. For small intervals the results can usually be obtained in
 *  logorithmic time, but querying large intervals can be slower.
 *
 * @section partitioner_prioritizing Prioritizing Work
 *
 *  The partitioner itself does not prioritize work or perform work automatically--it must be told what to do, usually through
 *  an engine.  However, the partitioner does have certain features that facilitate prioritization at higher layers. Namely, it
 *  has the CFG with special vertices, and AUM and a whole set of queries, an address map that can be traversed, and
 *  user-defined callbacks that are notified for certain CFG changes.
 *
 *  @li The special @em undiscovered vertex is commonly used to obtain a list of addresses where a basic block needs to be
 *      discovered.  Unfortunately these addresses are in no particular order and will change continually as pure placeholders
 *      are inserted and erased from the CFG, or a pure placeholder becomes a discovered basic block.
 *
 *  @li The special @em indeterminate vertex can be queried to find basic blocks that might need more analysis. For instance,
 *      an indirect jump that results in an abstract successor might be a point where an inter-block data-flow analysis could
 *      nail down the successor to a concrete value or a set of values.  A common example is case-choosing code for a C
 *      "switch" statement.
 *
 *  @li The address usage map (AUM) can be queried to find addresses where instructions haven't been discovered yet. This
 *      technique is usually combined with a memory map traversal so that only executable mapped addresses need be considered
 *      rather than the entire 4GB (or larger) specimen address space.
 *
 *  @li The user can register a callback (or callbacks) that will be notified each time a basic block or placeholder is
 *      attached or detached from the CFG, thus giving the user a chance to discover new work areas and prioritize them.
 *
 *  The base implementation of @ref Engine uses these features to prioritize its work and can be consulted as an example.
 *
 * @section partitioner_provisional Provisional Detection
 *
 *  (This section is a placeholder for an idea that is not yet implemented.)
 *
 *  Sometimes one wants to ask the question "does a recursive disassembly starting at some particular address look reasonable?"
 *  and avoid making any changes if it doesn't.  This can be accomplished by creating a second "provisional" partitioner which
 *  is either in its initial empty state or a copy of the current partitioner, running the query, and examining the result.
 *  If the result looks reasonable, then the provisional partitioner can be assigned to the current partitioner.
 *
 *  When a partitioner is copied (by the copy constructor or by assignment) it makes a new copy of the CFG and the address
 *  mapping.  The new copy points to the same instructions and basic blocks as the original, but since both of these items are
 *  constant (other than basic block analysis results) they are sharing read-only information.
 *
 *  The cost of copying the CFG is linear in the number of vertices and edges.  The cost of copying the address map is linear
 *  in the number of instructions (or slightly more if instructions overlap).
 *
 *  A more efficient mechanism might be developed in the future.
 *
 * @section partitioner_function_boundaries Function Boundary Determination
 *
 *  (This section is a placeholder for future documentation).
 *
 * @section partitioner_faq Frequenctly Asked Questions
 *
 * Q. Why is this class final?
 *
 * A. This class represents the low-level operations for partitioning instructions and is responsible for ensuring that certain
 *    data structures such as the CFG and AUM are always consistent.  The class is final to guarantee these invariants. Its
 *    behavior can only be modified by registering callbacks.  High-level behavior is implemented above this class such as in
 *    module functions (various Module*.h files) or engines derived from the @ref Engine class.  Additional data can be
 *    attached to a partitioner via attributes (see @ref Sawyer::Attribute). */

     *  Obtains a basic block and its instructions without modifying the control flow graph.  If the basic block already exists
     *  in the CFG/AUM then that block is returned, otherwise a new block is created but not added to the CFG/AUM. A basic
     *  block is created by adding one instruction at a time until one of the following conditions is met (tested in this
     *  order):
     *
     *  @li An instruction could not be obtained from the instruction provider via @ref discoverInstruction. The instruction
     *      provider should return null only if the address is not mapped with execute permission or is improperly aligned for
     *      the architecture.  The basic block's final instruction is the previous instruction, if any.  If the block is empty
     *      then it is said to be non-existing, and will have a special successor when added to the CFG.
     *
     *  @li The instruction is an "unknown" instruction. The instruction provider returns an unknown instruction if it isn't
     *      able to disassemble an instruction at the specified address but the address is mapped with execute permission and
     *      the address was properly aligned.  The partitioner treats this "unknown" instruction as a valid instruction with
     *      indeterminate successors (see below) and no semantics.
     *
     *  @li Note: at this point the user-defined basic block successors callbacks are invoked. They can query characteristics
     *      of the basic block, adjust the basic block successor cache (see below) and other characteristics of the block, and
     *      write values into a results structure that is used by some of the subsequent block termination conditions.
     *
     *  @li The instruction has a concrete successor address that is an address of a non-initial instruction in this
     *      block. Basic blocks cannot have a non-initial instruction with more than one incoming edge, therefore we've already
     *      added too many instructions to this block.  We could proceed two ways: (A) We could throw away this instruction
     *      with the back-edge successor and make the block terminate at the previous instruction. This causes the basic block
     *      to be as big as possible for as long as possible, which is a good thing if it is determined later that the
     *      instruction with the back-edge is not reachable anyway. (B) We could truncate the basic block at the back-edge
     *      target so that the instruction prior to that is the final instruction. This is good because it converges to a
     *      steady state faster, but could result in basic blocks that are smaller than optimal. (The current algorithm uses
     *      method A.)
     *
     *  @li The user-defined basic block callbacks indicated that the block should be terminated.  If the callback set the @c
     *      terminate member of the @c results output argument to @ref BasicBlockCallback::TERMINATE_NOW or @ref
     *      BasicBlockCallback::TERMINATE_PRIOR, then the current instruction either becomes the final instruction of the basic
     *      block, or the prior instruction becomes the final instruction.
     *
     *  @li The instruction is the final instruction of the basic block according to configuration information for that block.
     *      The basic block is terminated at this instruction.
     *
     *  @li The instruction causes this basic block to look like a function call.  This instruction becomes the final
     *      instruction of the basic block and when the block is inserted into the CFG/AUM the edge will be marked as a
     *      function call edge.  Function call instructions typically have one successor (the target function, usually
     *      concrete, but sometimes indeterminate), but the partitioner may eventually insert a "return" edge into the CFG when
     *      this basic block is attached.
     *
     *  @li The instruction doesn't have exactly one successor. Basic blocks cannot have a non-final instruction that branches,
     *      so this instruction becomes the final instruction.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is not a constant. If the successor cannot be resolved to a constant then this
     *      instruction becomes the final instruction.  If this basic block is eventually attached to the CFG/AUM then an edge
     *      to the special "indeterminate" vertex will be created.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is the starting address for the block on which we're working. A basic block's
     *      instructions are distinct by definition, so this instruction becomes the final instruction for the block.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is the starting address of a basic block already in the CFG. This is a common case and
     *      probably means that what we discovered earlier is correct.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is an instruction already in the CFG other than in the conflict block.  A "conflict
     *      block" is the basic block, if any, that contains as a non-first instruction the first instruction of this block. If
     *      the first instruction of the block being discovered is an instruction in the middle of some other basic block in
     *      the CFG, then we allow this block to use some of the same instructions as in the conflict block and we do not
     *      terminate construction of this block at this time. Usually what happens is the block being discovered uses all the
     *      final instructions from the conflict block; an exception is when an opaque predicate in the conflicting block is no
     *      longer opaque in the new block.  Eventually if the new block is attached to the CFG/AUM then the conflict block
     *      will be truncated.  When there is no conflict block then this instruction becomes the final instruction of the
     *      basic block.
     *
     *  @section successors Calculation of control flow successors
     *
     *  The basic block has a list of successor addresses and control flow edge types, but these are not added to the
     *  partitioner's CFG until the basic block is attached. A basic block's successor list can come from three places:
     *
     *  @li A block's successor list is initialized according to the final instruction. This list can be based on instruction
     *      pattern or semantic information for the entire block up to that point.
     *
     *  @li Basic block callbacks are allowed to adjust or replace the block's successor list.
     *
     *  @li If the configuration file has a successor list then that list is used.  The list only applies if the configuration
     *      for the basic block also specifies a final instruction address and that address matches the current final
     *      instruction of the basic block.

     *  grow up.

     *      instruction for which semantics are not known.
     *
     *  @li Constant offset, for which the @c toInteger predicate applied to the return value is true. I.e., the delta is a
     *      concrete value fits in a 64-bit signed integer.
     *
     *  @li Top, indicated by a non-null return value for which @c toInteger is false.  This results when two or more paths
     *      through the control flow graph result in different constant offsets. It can also occur when the algebraic
     *      simplifications that are built into ROSE fail to simplify a constant expression.

     *

     *  obtained. Basic block ownership is stored in the CFG, therefore if the provided basic block is not attached to the
     *  partitioner, the partitioner substitutes one that is attached. Runtime is O(log |V|) where |V| is the number of
     *  vertices in the CFG.
     *
     *  @li As a vector of any of the above. The returned vector is the union of the owning functions. Run time is O(N M) where
     *  N is the length of the vector and M is the time from above.

     *  Analyses a function to determine characteristics of its calling convention, such as which registers are callee-saved,
     *  which registers and stack locations are input parameters, and which are output parameters.   The calling convention
     *  analysis itself does not define the entire calling convention--instead, the analysis results must be matched against a
     *  dictionary of calling convention definitions.
     *
     *  Each function has a @ref Function::callingConventionDefinition "callingConventionDefinition" property that points to the
     *  best definition. That property is reset to null if this method reanalyzes the calling convention for that function.
     *  Assigning the best calling convention definition to a function is done by a global analysis that tries to chose the best
     *  calling convention over the entire set of functions (since a particular function's behavior often matches multiple
     *  definitions). This `functionCallingConvention` method doesn't make those global assignments, but @ref
     *  allFunctionCallingConventionDefinition does.
     *
     *  Since this analysis is based on data-flow, which is based on a control flow graph, the function must be attached to the
     *  CFG/AUM and all its basic blocks must also exist in the CFG/AUM.
     *
     *  Warning: If the specified function calls other functions for which a calling convention analysis has not been run the
     *  analysis of this function may be incorrect.  This is because the analysis of this function must know which registers
     *  are clobbered by the call in order to produce accurate results. See also, @ref allFunctionCallingConvention. If a
     *  default calling convention is supplied then it determines which registers are clobbered by a call to a function that
     *  hasn't been analyzed yet.
     *
     *  Calling convention analysis results are stored in the function object. If calling convention analysis has already been
