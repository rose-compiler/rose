/** Base class for engines driving the partitioner.
 *
 * The @ref Partitioner2::Engine is an abstract base class whose derived classes implement the algorithms for creating functions,
 * basic blocks, instructions, control flow graphs (CFGs), address usage maps (AUMs), static data blocks, and everything else that
 * can be stored in a @ref Partitioner2::Partitioner "Partitioner".
 *
 * Although subclasses can be instantiated directly, it is often easier to do so through the base class's factory methods. For
 * instance, a tool that operates on various kinds of specimens would want to decide what engine subclass to instantiate based on
 * the types of specimens that are being analyzed. The ROSE library defines a few sublcasses, and the factory mechanism allows
 * external tools to register their own subclasses.
 *
 * @section Rose_BinaryAnalysis_Partitioner2_Engine_factories Factories
 *
 * Using the engine factories is a two-step process: first the subclasses are registered with the ROSE library, then the ROSE
 * library chooses which engine should be instantiated and does so.
 *
 * A subclass is registered by instantiating a "factory instance" of the subclass and calling @ref registerFactory, which takes
 * shared ownership of the factory instance. Additional member functions such as @ref deregisterFactory and @ref registeredFactories
 * can be used to manipulate the factory list. The engine types that are built into ROSE are registered automatically and appear at
 * the beginning of the list.
 *
 * To directly instantiate an instance of a subclass without going through the factory mechanism, one calls the static @c instance
 * method of the subclass. The @c instance method allocates a new instance in the heap and returns a shared-ownership pointer to the
 * new instance.  This is how almost all binary analysis works in ROSE.
 *
 * On the other hand, to instantiate an engine using the factory method, one calls the @ref Engine::forge static member
 * function. The words "forge" and "factory" both start with "f" as a reminder that they go together in this API. The @ref forge
 * method will scan the list of registered factories from the end toward the beginning and the first factory whose @ref matchFactory
 * predicate returns true will be the type of engine to be used. The engine actually returned is not the registered factory
 * directly, but the result of calling @ref instanceFromFactory on the registered factory.
 *
 * @section Rose_BinaryAnalysis_Partitioner2_Engine_commandlineparsing Command-line parsing
 *
 * Every engine instance has a @ref settings property. Currently this is shared by all engine types, but in the future we may make
 * this more extensible. Every engine supports ROSE's command-line parsing (@ref Sawyer::CommandLine) to modify its settings from
 * the command-line. There is a chicken-or-egg dilemma with command-line parsing: in order to choose the correct engine type, we
 * need to find the command-line positional arguments that describe the specimen; in order to find the positional arguments, we need
 * to be able to accurately parse the command-line switches; in order to parse the engine-specific command-line switches, we need to
 * know which engine will be used for the parsing.
 *
 * The solution that ROSE uses isn't perfect, but works well in practice. Each engine type is able to register its command-line
 * switches as a switch group within a command-line parser. As long as the switches don't conflict with each other, or can be
 * disambiguated to not conflict, we're able to parse the command-line switches as the union of all the switches from all known
 * engine types. Switches can be disambiguated by giving each engine type its own switch group name (i.e., optional switch
 * prefix). For example, the JVM engine might use "--[jvm-]foo" while the binary machine engine uses "--[binary-]foo".
 *
 * In order to choose a matching factory from the list of factories, ROSE constructs a temporary command-line parser that handles
 * the switches from all known engines and binds the parser to the registered factories (i.e., the presence of a switch modifies
 * the settings in the factory instance). ROSE then parses the command-line to find the specimen positional arguments which it uses
 * to choose a factory instance. Once the factory instance is chosen, ROSE instantiates a regular instance from the factory and
 * constructs a new command-line parser with just that engine's switches, and bound to the engine being returned. Later, when the
 * tool parses the command-line for real and applies the parse result, the returned engine's settings are updated.
 *
 * Although this mechanism for handling engine-specific command-line switches is not perfect, we think it will provide a means by
 * which tools can define their own command-line switches, and other factories besides @ref Partitioner2::Engine can operate in
 * similar ways.
 *
 * @section Rose_BinaryAnalysis_Partitioner2_Engine_basic Basic usage
 *
 * An engine drives the process of building a @ref Partitioner2::Partitioner which is then used as an efficient means of obtaining
 * information that's needed during analysis. Although every engine can operate in a different way, there's a common API that's
 * intended to be quite general. The engine API is divided into abstraction layers. The most abstract layer consists of functions
 * that do the most things in one step, from parsing of command-lines to generation of the @ref Partitioner2::Partitioner
 * "Partitioner" and/or abstract syntax tree (AST).  The next layer of less abstract functions does smaller parts, such as parsing
 * containers like ELF or PE, loading parts of specimen files into memory, finding related specimens like shared libraries, linking
 * specimens together into a common address space, organizing instructions into basic blocks and functions, creating an AST, etc.
 * Finally, at the least level of abstraction, many of the functions are specific enough to be defined only in subclasses.
 *
 * Here's an example of basic usage of the engine to instantiate and populate a @ref Partitioner2::Partitioner "Partitioner" that
 * can be used for analysis. First, the tool needs to define the necessary classes, which it can do by including either the
 * top-level "Partitioner2.h" header, or the headers for the individual Partitioner2 types.
 *
 * @code
 *   #include <rose.h>
 *   #include <Rose/BinaryAnalysis/Partitioner2.h>
 *   using namespace Rose;
 *   namespace P2 = Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Most tools, after initializing the ROSE library, will create a command-line parser to parse the tool's own switches.
 *
 * @code
 *   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *       ROSE_INITIALIZE;
 *       std::string purpose = "disassembles a binary specimen";
 *       std::string description =
 *           "This tool disassembles the specified specimen and presents the "
 *           "results as a pseudo assembly listing, that is, a listing intended "
 *           "for human consumption rather than assembly.";
 *
 *       ToolSettings settings;
 *       Sawyer::CommandLine::Parser parser = buildSwitchParser(settings);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In order for the tool to choose the correct engine, it needs to be able to find the positional command-line arguments that
 * describe the specimen. The tool could do all its own command-line parsing and adjust the values in a @ref Engine::Settings object
 * which it ultimately copies into an engine instance, or it could use ROSE's command-line parsing mechanism. We'll show the latter
 * since we already started creating such a parser above.
 *
 * Since we're using ROSE to parse the command-line, we pass the command-line and our partial command-line parser to the @ref
 * Partitioner2::Engine::forge "forge" method like this:
 *
 * @code
 *       P2::Engine::Ptr engine = P2::Engine::forge(argc, argv, parser);
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the forge call returns, it also adjusts the parser so it knows how to parse the command-line switches that are specific to
 * the returned engine type, and those switches are bound to the settings in that returned engine instance. Thus the tool is now
 * able to parse the command-line, update the settings in the engine, and obtain the positional arguments that describe the
 * specimen.
 *
 * @code
 *       std::vector<std::string> specimen = parser.parse(argc, argv).apply().unreachedArgs();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Finally, now that the engine has been obtained, the tool can cause the engine to produce a fully initialized @ref Partitioner, or
 * do any of the other things that an engine is designed to do.
 *
 * @code
 *       P2::Partitioner::Ptr partitioner = engine.partition(specimen);
 * @endcode
 *
 * On the other hand, if you perform your own command-line parser then you'll have the engine settings and the specimen arguments
 * already parsed, in which case you can create the engine with fewer steps:
 *
 * @code
 *  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *      P2::Engine::Settings settings;
 *      std::vector<std::string> specimen = parseCommandLine(settings);
 *      auto engine = P2::Engine::forge(specimen);
 *      auto partitioner = engine->partition(specimen);
 * @endcode
 *
