/** MIPS32 instruction decoder.
 *
 *  MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction
 *  set architectures (ISA) developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States.
 *
 *  There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and
 *  64-bit implementations, respectively). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit; 64-bit versions were developed later. As of
 *  April 2017, the current version of MIPS is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS Iâ€“V by defining the
 *  privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture.
 *
 *  The MIPS architecture has several optional extensions. MIPS-3D which is a simple set of floating-point SIMD instructions
 *  dedicated to common 3D tasks, MDMX (MaDMaX) which is a more extensive integer SIMD instruction set using the 64-bit
 *  floating-point registers, MIPS16e which adds compression to the instruction stream to make programs take up less room, and MIPS
 *  MT, which adds multithreading capability.
 *
 *  The first release of MIPS32, based on MIPS II, added conditional moves, prefetch instructions, and other features from the R4000
 *  and R5000 families of 64-bit processors. The MUL and MADD (multiply-add) instructions, previously available in some
 *  implementations, were added to the MIPS32 specifications, as were cache control instructions. For the purpose of cache control,
 *  both SYNC and SYNCI instructions were prepared. */
