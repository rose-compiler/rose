/** Suport for finding strings in memory.
 *
 *  This namespace provides support for various kinds of strings in specimen memory, including an @ref StringFinder "analysis"
 *  that searches for strings in specimen memory.  A string is a sequence of characters encoded in one of a variety of ways in
 *  memory.  For instance, NUL-terminated ASCII is a common encoding from C compilers.  The characters within the string must
 *  all satisfy some valid-character predicate.  The terms used in this analysis are based on the Unicode standard, and are
 *  defined here in terms of string encoding (translation of a string as printed to a sequence of octets). Although this
 *  analysis can encode strings, its main purpose is decoding strings from an octet stream into a sequence of code points.
 *
 *  Unicode and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set, together constitute a modern, unified
 *  character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets (bytes), they separately define what characters are
 *  available, their numbering, how those numbers are encoded as a series of "code units" (limited-size numbers), and finally
 *  how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The idea behind this decomposition is to establish a universal set of
 *  characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways. To describe this model correctly one needs more precise terms than
 *  "character set" and "character encoding." The terms used in the modern model follow:
 *
 *  A character repertoire is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no
 *  additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it
 *  may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the Windows code pages). The
 *  characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into basic
 *  information units. The basic variants of the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets can be broken down into letters, digits,
 *  punctuation, and a few special characters such as the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are
 *  displayed in the same order they are read. Even with these alphabets, however, diacritics pose a complication: they can be
 *  regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known as a precomposed character), or as
 *  separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic
 *  combination to be used in text. Ligatures pose similar problems. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are
 *  represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and
 *  glyphs that are joined together in different ways for different situations.
 *
 *  A coded character set (CCS) specifies how to represent a repertoire of characters using a number of (typically
 *  non-negative) integer values called code points. For example, in a given repertoire, a character representing the capital
 *  letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be assigned to the integer 65, the character for "B" to 66, and so on. A complete
 *  set of characters and corresponding integers is a coded character set. Multiple coded character sets may share the same
 *  repertoire; for example ISO/IEC 8859-1 and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to
 *  different codes. In a coded character set, each code point only represents one character, i.e., a coded character set is a
 *  function.
 *
 *  A character encoding form (CEF) specifies the conversion of a coded character set's integer codes into a set of
 *  limited-size integer code values that facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers in binary form using a fixed
 *  number of bits (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit
 *  units would only be able to directly represent integers from 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger integers could be
 *  represented if more than one 16-bit unit could be used. This is what a CEF accommodates: it defines a way of mapping a
 *  single code point from a range of, say, 0 to 1.4 million, to a series of one or more code values from a range of, say, 0 to
 *  65,535.
 *
 *  The simplest CEF system is simply to choose large enough units that the values from the coded character set can be encoded
 *  directly (one code point to one code value). This works well for coded character sets that fit in 8 bits (as most legacy
 *  non-CJK encodings do) and reasonably well for coded character sets that fit in 16 bits (such as early versions of
 *  Unicode). However, as the size of the coded character set increases (e.g. modern Unicode requires at least 21
 *  bits/character), this becomes less and less efficient, and it is difficult to adapt existing systems to use larger code
 *  values. Therefore, most systems working with later versions of Unicode use either UTF-8, which maps Unicode code points to
 *  variable-length sequences of octets, or UTF-16, which maps Unicode code points to variable-length sequences of 16-bit
 *  words.
 *
 *  Next, a character encoding scheme (CES) specifies how the fixed-size integer code values should be mapped into an octet
 *  sequence suitable for saving on an octet-based file system or transmitting over an octet-based network. With Unicode, a
 *  simple character encoding scheme is used in most cases, simply specifying whether the bytes for each integer should be in
 *  big-endian or little-endian order (even this isn't needed with UTF-8). However, there are also compound character encoding
 *  schemes, which use escape sequences to switch between several simple schemes (such as ISO/IEC 2022), and compressing
 *  schemes, which try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as SCSU, BOCU, and Punycode).
 *
 *  Once the code points of a string are encoded as octets, the string as a whole needs some description to demarcate it from
 *  surrounding data. ROSE currently supports two styles of demarcation: length-encoded strings and terminated strings.  A
 *  length-encoded string's code point octets are preceded by octets that encode the string length, usually in terms of the
 *  number of code points. Decoding such a string consists of decoding the length and then decoding code points until the
 *  required number of code points have been obtained.  On the other hand, terminated strings are demarcated from surrounding
 *  data by a special code point such as the NUL character for ASCII strings. Decoding a terminated string consists of decoding
 *  code points until a terminator is found, then discarding the terminator.
 *
 * @section ex1 Example 1
 *
 *  This example shows how to find all strings in memory that is readable but not writable using a list of common encodings
 *  such as C-style NUL-terminated printable ASCII, zero terminated UTF-16 little-endian, 2-byte little-endian length encoded
 *  ASCII, etc.
 *
 * @code
 *  #include <Rose/BinaryAnalysis/String.h>     // binary analysis string support
 *  using namespace Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Strings;
 *  MemoryMap map = ...;                        // initialized elsewhere
 *
 *  StringFinder finder;                        // holds settings
 *  finder.settings().minLength = 5;            // no strings shorter than 5 characters
 *  finder.settings().maxLength = 65536;        // ignore very long strings
 *  finder.insertCommonEncoders();              // how to match strings
 *  finder.find(map.require(MemoryMap::READABLE).prohibit(MemoryMap::WRITABLE));
 *
 *  for (const EncodedString &string: finder.strings()) {
 *      std::cout <<"string at " <<string.address() <<" for " <<string.size() <<" bytes\n";
 *      std::cout <<"encoding: " <<string.encoder()->name() <<"\n";
 *      std::cout <<"narrow value: \"" <<StringUtility::cEscape(string.narrow()) <<"\"\n"; // std::string
 *      std::cout <<"wide value: " <<string.wide() <<"\n"; // std::wstring
 *  }
 *
 *  // This works too if you're not picky about the output format
 *  std::cout <<finder;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section ex2 Example 2
 *
 *  The @ref StringFinder analysis is tuned for searching for strings at unknown locations while trying to decode multiple
 *  encodings simultaneously. If all you want to do is read a single string from a known location having a known encoding then
 *  you're probabily better off reading it directly from the @ref MemoryMap. The @ref StringFinder analysis can be used for
 *  that, but it's probably overkill. In any case, here's the overkill version to find a 2-byte little endian length-encoded
 *  UTF-8 string:
 *
 * @code
 *  #include <Rose/BinaryAnalysis/String.h>
 *  using namespace Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Strings;
 *  MemoryMap map = ...;                        // initialized elsewhere
 *  Address stringVa = ...;                 // starting address of string
 *
 *  StringFinder finder;                        // holds settings
 *  finder.settings().minLength = 0;            // no strings shorter than 5 characters
 *  finder.settings().maxLength = 65536;        // ignore very long strings
 *  finder.encoder(lengthEncodedString(basicLengthEncoder(2, ByteOrder::ORDER_LSB), // 2-byte little-endian length
 *                                     utf8CharacterEncodingForm(),                 // UTF-8 encoding
 *                                     basicCharacterEncodingScheme(1),             // 1:1 mapping to octets
 *                                     anyCodePoint());                             // allow any characters
 *  std::wstring s;                                   
 *  for (const EncodedString &string: finder.find(map.at(stringVa)).strings()) {
 *      s = string.wide();
 *      break;
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section ex3 Example 3
 *
 *  The encoders can also be used to decode directly from a stream of octets. For instance, lets say you have a vector of
 *  octets that map 1:1 to code values, and then you want to decode the code values as a UTF-8 stream to get some code
 *  points. All decoders are implemented as state machines to make it efficient to send the same octets to many decoders
 *  without having to rescan/reread from a memory map.  The UTF-8 decoder decodes one octet at a time and when it enters the
 *  FINAL_STATE or COMPLETED_STATE then a decoded code value can be consumed.
 *
 * @code
 *  #include <Rose/BinaryAnalysis/String.h>
 *  using namespace Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Strings;
 *  std::vector<Octet> octets = ...; // initialized elsewhere
 *
 *  // Instantiate the encoder/decoder. These things are all reference
 *  // counted so there's no need to explicitly free them.
 *  Utf8CharacterEncodingForm::Ptr utf8 = utf8CharacterEncodingForm();
 * 
 *  CodePoints codePoints;
 *  for (Octet octet: octets) {
 *      CodeValue codeValue = octet; // 1:1 translation
 *      if (isDone(utf8->decode(codeValue))) {
 *          codePoints.push_back(utf8->consume());
 *      } else if (utf8->state() == ERROR_STATE) {
 *          utf8->reset(); // skip this code value
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode */
