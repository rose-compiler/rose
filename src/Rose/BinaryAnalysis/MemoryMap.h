/** An efficient mapping from an address space to stored data.
 *
 *  This class, a specialization of @ref Sawyer::Container::AddressMap, maps 64-bit addresses to bytes. The address space is
 *  organized into non-overlapping, contiguous "segments" (@ref Sawyer::Container::AddressSegment) that impart properties such
 *  as names and access permissions. Each segment points into a buffer (subclass of @ref Sawyer::Container::Buffer) where the
 *  data bytes are stored.
 *
 *  The buffers pointed to by the segments are reference counted with smart pointers. Normally, each segment points to the
 *  beginning of its own buffer, but this is not always true. Sometimes segments share buffers, and sometimes segments point
 *  into the middle of buffers. This flexibility allows parts of an address space to be erased or replaced even from the middle
 *  of existing segments. It also allows the same data to be mapped and shared at multiple addresses.
 *
 *  The MemoryMap objects are also reference counted and created by the @ref instance method. Copying a MemoryMap object is
 *  shallow: the new object will have its own mapping and segments, but will share the underying buffers with the source map.
 *
 *  Most of the low level functionality for a MemoryMap comes from the @ref Sawyer::Container::AddressMap base class, such as
 *  the ability to add, erase, or replace parts of the address space and the ability to read data from the address space. The
 *  base class documentation has lots of example code. On the other hand, most of the more complex behaviors are defined in the
 *  MemoryMap class, such as initializing a MemoryMap from a Linux process or reading a NUL-terminated string.
 *
 *  Here's an example of mapping a file into an address space at virtual address 0x08040000 and then temporarily replacing the
 *  second 1kB page of the file with our own data.  We demonstrate using a @ref Sawyer::Container::MappedBuffer because these
 *  are very fast for large files, especially if only small parts of the file are ever accessed.
 *
 * @code
 *  using namespace Sawyer::Container;
 *
 *  // Create and initialize the overlay data
 *  uint8_t myData[8192];
 *  initialize(myData, myDataSize);
 *
 *  // Create the two buffers: one for the file, one for the overlay data
 *  Buffer::Ptr fileBuf = MappedBuffer::instance("the_file", boost::iostreams::mapped_file::readonly);
 *  Buffer::Ptr dataBuf = StaticBuffer::instance(myData, 8192);
 *
 *  // Create the memory map.
 *  MemoryMap::Ptr map = MemoryMap::instance();
 *  map->insert(AddressInterval::baseSize(0x08040000, fileBuf->size()),
 *              AddressSegment(fileBuf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_READ, "the file contents"));
 *  map->insert(AddressInterval::baseSize(0x08040000+1024, dataBuf->size()),
 *             AddressSegment(dataBuf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_RW, "data overlay"));
 * @endcode
 *
 *  A MemoryMap provides methods to easily read from and write to the underlying data storage, addressing it in terms of the
 *  virtual address space.  These functions return the addresses that were accessed, and are prefixed by calls that describe
 *  what data is to be accessed.
 *
 * @code
 *  // read part of the data, right across the file/overlay boundary
 *  uint8_t data[4096];
 *  size_t nRead = map->at(0x08040100).limit(sizeof data).read(data).size();
 *  assert(nread == sizeof data);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The Sawyer documentation contains many more examples.

     *
     *  The locator string is a file name preceded by various other parameters to control where the file is loaded in memory.

     *
     * @verbatim
     *  :[ADDR][+VMSIZE][=PERM]:[OFFSET[+FSIZE]]:FILENAME
     * @endverbatim
     *
     *  The fields between the first and second colon are parameters for virtual memory; the fields between the second and
     *  third colon are parameters for the file.  Their meanings are:
     *
     * @li @c ADDR: The virtual address where the first byte of the file is mapped.  This can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal,
     *     or binary using the usual C syntax.  If no address is specified then the file is mapped at the lowest unmapped region
     *     which is large enough to hold the file.
     *
     * @li @c VMSIZE: Size of virtual memory to map.  If VMSIZE is not specified then it is either the FSIZE (if specified) or the
     *     file size.  On POSIX systems the file size is that which is reported by @p stat, and on other systems it is the number of
     *     bytes that can be read from the file. The size can be specified as decimal, hexadecimal, or binary with the usual C
     *     syntax.  If VMSIZE is greater than the specified or calculated FSIZE then the data from the file is padded with zero
     *     bytes.
     *
     * @li @c PERM: Accessibility for the mapped segment.  If present, it should be any of the letters "r", "w", and/or "x" in
     *     that order to indicate readable, writable, and/or executable.  If not present, the accessibility of the segment is
     *     the same as the user's accessibility of the file (on POSIX systems; "rwx" on Windows systems).
     *
     * @li @c OFFSET: Byte offset within file for first byte to map. If no offset is specified then zero is assumed. The size can be
     *     decimal, hexadecimal, or binary in the usual C sytax.
     *
     * @li @c FSIZE: Number of file bytes to map.  If not specified the entire readable content of the file is mapped beginning
     *     at the specified OFFSET but not exceeding a specified VMSIZE.  If this number of bytes cannot be read from the file
     *     then an error is thrown.
     *
     * @li @c FILENAME: Name of file to read. The file must be readable by the user and its contents are copied into the memory
     *     map.  Once inside the memory map, the segment can be given any accessibility according to PERM.  The name of the
     *     segment will be the non-directory part of the FILENAME (e.g., on POSIX systems, the part after the final slash).
     *
     * @section exampes Examples
     *
     *  To load a couple raw files at the lowest available addresses:
     *
     * @code
     *  :::myfile1.bin :::myfile2.bin
     * @endcode
     *
     *  To load a 4k page of zeros with read and execute permission at address 0x7ffff000 (won't work on Microsoft systems):
     *
     * @code
     *  :0x7ffff000+0x1000=rx::/dev/zero
     * @code
     *
     *  On Microsoft Windows one could create a large file containing zeros:
     *
     * @code
     *  :0x7ffff000+0x1000=rx::myzeros.dat
     * @endcode

     *  damaged to the point where it cannot be loaded by ROSE's @c frontend. Both sections are zero-padded since the
     *  memory segment size is larger than the file size.  But if one wants to more closely emulate the Windows loader, leave
     *  off the file sizes:
