/** A general, thread-safe way to report progress made on some task.
 *
 *  Consider some long-running task that needs to be performed by some worker thread or collection of worker threads. There may
 *  be other unrelated listener threads that need to monitor the progress of the task, such as a GUI thread that updates a
 *  progress bar widget.  This can be accomplished in a general way by having an intermediatey object to which workers can
 *  write progress reports and other threads can query those reports.
 *
 *  The intention is that each long-running task will have its own @ref Progress object into which reports are written, and the
 *  report will be a floating point number between zero (work just started) and one (work is almost complete). When work on the
 *  task completes (either because the task was finished or it had an error), one of the workers calls @ref finished to let all
 *  the listeners know there will be nothing new to report.
 *
 *  Sometimes a task has multiple phases and it's hard to predict the total amount of work across all phases before earlier
 *  phases have completed. Therefore, progress reports have two parts: not only do they have a completion amount, they
 *  also have a phase name.  When a @ref Progress object is first created, its phase name is empty and the completion
 *  amount is zero.  There is no intrinsic @ref Progress requirement that phases occur in any particular order, or that the
 *  completion amount is monotonically increasing, or that the completion amount is in the interval [0..1] although listeners
 *  might be expecting certain things.
 *
 *  In order to support a hierarchy of reports, such as when one long running analysis calls other long-running analyses and
 *  they in turn also have multiple phases, the progress object has a stack of reports that is adjusted with @ref push and @ref
 *  pop methods.  When progress is reported to a listener, the listener has a choice between getting the name of the top-most
 *  report or getting a name that is constructed by joining all the non-empty names in the stack.  There's also a @ref
 *  ProgressTask class that does the push and pop using RAII.
 *
 *  Each @ref Progress object is shared between worker threads and querying threads--it cannot be deleted when the last worker
 *  is finished because other threads might still be listening, and it cannot be deleted when nothing is listening because
 *  workers might still need to write progress reports to it. Therefore each @ref Progress object is allocated on the heap and
 *  referenced through thread-safe, shared-ownership pointers. Allocation is done by the @ref instance factory and the object
 *  should not be explicitly deleted by the user.
 *
 *  Example:
 * @code
 *  // function that does lots of work and optionally reports its progress.
 *  void worker(Progress::Ptr progress) {
 *      for (size_t i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
 *          do_some_work();
 *          if (progress)
 *              progress->update((double)i/1000000);
 *      }
 *      if (progress)
 *          progress->finished(1.0);
 *  }
 *
 *  // Start a worker and provide a way for it to report its progress
 *  Progress::Ptr progress = Progress::instance();
 *  boost::thread_t worker(worker, progress);
 *
 *  // Report progress on standard error each time it changes, but not more than once every 10 seconds
 *  progress->reportChanges(boost::chrono::seconds(10), [](const Progress::Report &rpt) -> bool {
 *      std::cout <<rpt.phase <<": " <<(100*rpt.completion) <<" percent completed\n";
 *      return true; // keep listening until task is finished
 *  });
 *
 *  // Or report progress every 10 seconds whether it changed or not
 *  progress->reportRegularly(boost::chrono::seconds(10), [](const Progress::Report &rpt, double age) -> bool {
 *      std::cout <<rpt.phase <<": " <<(100*rpt.completion) <<" percent completed\n";
 *      return true; // keep listening until task is finished
 *  });
 *
 *  // Or query the progress in an event loop
 *  while (!progress->isFinished()) {
 *      Progress::Report rpt = progress->reportLatest().first;
 *      std::cout <<rpt.phase <<": " <<(100*rpt.completion) <<" percent completed\n";
 *      do_other_stuff();
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The following guidelines should be used when writing a long-running task, such as a ROSE analysis or transformation, that
 *  supports progress reporting. These guidelines assume that the task is encapsulated in a class (as most analyses and
 *  transformations should be) so that an application is able to have more than one instance of the task. A task that's implemented
 *  as a single function should take an argument of type `const Rose::Progress::Ptr&` (which may be a null progress object), and a
 *  task that's implemented in a namespace should try to provide an API similar to a class (the main difference will be that there's
 *  only once "instance" of the analysis).
 *
 *  @li The task class should have a private data member to hold a @ref Progress::Ptr.
 *
 *  @li The class should initialize its progress reporter variable to a non-null value by calling @ref Progress::instance
 *  during construction. The user can reset this to null if he really doesn't want the task to spend any time updating
 *  progress reports.
 *
 *  @li The class should provide an API for users to query or change the progress report for any particular task. The
 *  preferred protyptes are "Rose::Progress::Ptr progress() const" and "void progress(const Rose::Progress::Ptr&)" although you
 *  should use whatever scheme is consistent with the rest of your API.
 *
 *  @li The task should expect that the progress object could be null, in which case the user is saying that there's no need
 *  for the analyzer to spend time updating any progress reports because nobody will be listening for them.
 *
 *  @li The task should update the progress with a completion ratio between 0 and 1 without specifying a phase name (unless the
 *  analysis has multiple phases).  I.e., use `update(double)` instead of `update(Report)`.
 *
 *  @li If the task creates an inner task object that's able to report progress, then the same progress object should be
 *  assigned to the inner task.
 *
 *  @li If the task calls an inner task that uses the same progress object as the outer task (see previous bullet) then the outer
 *  task should use the @ref ProgressTask RAII aproach by declaring a variable like this: `ProgressTask pt(progress, "name_of_task",
 *  completion)`, where @c completion is the progress of the outer task after the inner task returns (either normally or by
 *  exception).
 *
 *  @li The task should call @ref finished when the analysis has completed if the progress object is non-null, even if the
 *  task has some other mechanism to notify listeners that it has completed.
 *
 *  Here's an example analysis that uses these guidelines:
 *
 * @code
 *  class OuterAnalyzer {
 *      Rose::Progress::Ptr progress_;
 *
 *  public:
 *      OuterAnalyzer(): progress_(Rose::Progress::instance()) {}
 *
 *      Rose::Progress::Ptr progress() const {
 *          return progress_;
 *      }
 *
 *      void progress(const Rose::Progress::Ptr &p) {
 *          progress_ = p;
 *      }
 *
 *      void run() {
 *          size_t totalExpectedWork = 3 * nSteps;
 *          size_t workCompleted = 0;
 *
 *          for (size_t step = 0; step < nSteps; ++step, workCompleted += 3) {
 *              if (progress_)
 *                  progress_->update((double)workCompleted / totalExpectedWork);
 *
 *              do_something();
 *              if(progress_)
 *                  progress_->update((double)(workCompleted+1) / totalExpectedWork);
 *
 *              // Run an inner analysis. Assume InnerAnalysis has the same API as OuterAnalysis
 *              {
 *                  ProgressTask pt(progress_, "inner", (double)(workCompleted+2) / totalExpectedWork);
 *                  InnerAnalysis inner;
 *                  inner.progress(progress_);
 *                  inner.run();
 *              }
 *
 *              // progress was already emitted by ProgressTask destructor
 *              do_something_more();
 *          }
 *
 *          if (progress_)
 *              progress_->finished(1.0);
 *      }
 *  };
