/** Binary analysis.
 *
 *  This namespace contains ROSE binary analysis features, such as the ability to parse file formats like ELF and PE; to disassemble
 *  machine instructions and byte code and organize them into basic blocks and functions; to analyze code in architecture
 *  independent ways, to generate pseudo-assembly listings, and more.
 *
 *  @section rose_binaryanalysis_background Background
 *
 *  ROSE was originally designed as a source-to-source compiler for analyzing and transforming C source code in an HPC environment.
 *  Later, more source languages like Fortran, C++, C#, Java, Cuda, OpenCL, PHP, Python, Ada, and Jovial were added. At some point
 *  along the line, it was observed that analyzing and transforming binary executables could use much of the same mechanisms as
 *  source code: parsing of container formats like ELF and PE, representing instructions and static data as an abstract syntax tree;
 *  describing the runtime semantics of instructions; analyzing an intermediate representation (IR) of a specimen; transforming the
 *  IR; and unparsing the IR as a new specimen or as assembly language.
 *
 *  Of course there are also many differences between binary code and source code, but ROSE is situated in the unique position of
 *  being able to process both. On the one hand, it can operate on a binary specimen for which no source code is available, and on
 *  the other hand it can perform analysis and transformations where both source and binary are available.
 *
 *  @section rose_binaryanalysis_features Feature Set
 *
 *  ROSE can parse a variety of binary inputs. It can parse executable formats such as Linux ELF executables, shared libraries, core
 *  dumps, object files, and library archives; and Microsoft Windows PE and DOS executables and libraries. It can parse memory
 *  initialization formats such as Motorola S-Records, Intel HEX files, and raw memory dumps. It can analyze running or paused
 *  programs on Linux. ROSE can also analyze combinations of these formats, such as an ELF file extended by providing additional
 *  initialized memory from an S-Record file. It has a mini command-line language for specifying this for all binary analysis
 *  tools. For a full list, see the man pages generated by any binary analysis tool. The analyzable data from the binary specimens
 *  are loaded into a @ref MemoryMap "memory map", which is able to represent an entire address space.
 *
 *  ROSE has @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Disassembler "instruction decoders" that decode single binary machine instructions into
 *  abstract syntax trees (ASTs). ROSE supports ARM, AMD64 (x86_64), Intel x86, MIPS, Motorola 68k, PowerPC (32- and 64-bit), Java
 *  byte code, common intermediate language (CIL), user-defined instruction sets, and more. To get a full list, use the "--isa=list"
 *  argument supported by most ROSE binary analysis tools.
 *
 *  The ROSE @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2 "partitioner" (the layer responsible for partitioning memory into instructions
 *  and static data and then organizing those instructions into basic blocks and functions) uses a hybrid linear sweep and recursive
 *  descent approach that handles things like overlapping instructions (on architectures where that's possible), interleaved
 *  functions, rewritten execution flow, and more. ROSE supports multiple approaches for partitioning: the @ref
 *  Partitioner2::Partitioner object holds the results of partitioning and is what most analyses query, and the different approaches
 *  to building these objects are implemented in various subclasses of @ref Partitioner2::Engine. For instance, partitioning an ELF
 *  x86 binary is very different than partioning a Java class file--the former is undecidable while the latter is well specified.
 *
 *  In addition to being able to decode instructions, ROSE understands how instructions operate, i.e., their @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics "semantics". This layer lowers machine instructions to a few dozen @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics::BaseSemantics::RiscOperators "RISC-like" operations. ROSE's semantics are
 *  implemented in extensible C++ classes rather than a domain-specific language, and this enables the semantics to be specialized
 *  for various situations. For instance, the same API is used for both @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics::ConcreteSemantics "concrete emulation" and @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics::SymbolicSemantics "symbolic execution", and is specialized in other places to do
 *  @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics::IntervalSemantics "interval analysis", @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics::TaintSemantics "tainted flow analysis", @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::FeasiblePath
 *  "feasible path analysis", @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::ModelChecker "model checking", etc.  Some of the semantic domains (those
 *  derived from the symbolic semantics) can interface directly with @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::SmtSolver "SMT solvers". ROSE's
 *  hardware models are generally simplifications in order to make analysis more tractable, so not all aspects of every instruction
 *  are accurately modeled. Fortunately, users can extend this layer in order to design and use more accurate machine models.
 *
 *  ROSE is designed so that most analysis is architecture independent. The @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Architecture "architecture"
 *  layer describes the architectures in ways that other analysis components can understand. This layer describes such things as
 *  @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::RegisterDictionary "registers" and @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::CallingConvention
 *  "calling-conventions", but also points to the architecture's instruction decoders, instruction semantics, control flow
 *  information, and unparsers.  Users can define new architectures by registering their own classes with the ROSE library at
 *  runtime: either in their own tools via an architecture registration API, or for any ROSE binary analysis tool by specifing an
 *  architecture shared library with the "--architectures" command-line switch.
 *
 *  ROSE uses a unified assembly language common across all architectures in order to aid human understanding. The process of
 *  transcoding from an AST to an assembly listing is called "unparsing" in ROSE, and the binary analysis @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Unparser "unparser" is highly configurable and extensible. The assembly listings produced by most binary
 *  analysis tools typically include information about functions, basic blocks, addresses, the machine instruction bytes,
 *  information about stack behavior, the instruction mnemonic and its operands, and comments describing what the instruction
 *  does. Operands use infix C-like arithmetic operators rather than architecture-specific representations of addressing modes. In
 *  the simplest case, for any instruction you can say @ref SgAsmInstruction::toString "`insn->toString()`".
 *
 *  A number of binary analysis tools are distributed with the open-source ROSE library. Additional tools are potentially available
 *  from other repositories and have various (usually more restrictive) release and licensing requirements. Contact the ROSE team
 *  for more information about these other tools.
 *
 *  @section rose_binaryanalysis_configuration Configuration
 *
 *  In order to support binary analysis, ROSE needs to be configured for binary analysis during build time. See documentation
 *  concerning ROSE's various build systems for details.
 *
 *  A number of optional supporting libraries can be configured, and the binary analysis capabilities in ROSE will be adjusted based
 *  on what software is available at build time. The binary analysis tools distributed with ROSE have a `--version-long` switch that
 *  will display the features that are enabled. For example:
 *
 *  ```console
 *  $ bat-ana --version-long
 *    ROSE 0.11.145.11 (configured Wed Dec 13 10:00:00 2023 -0800)

 *
 *  @section rose_binaryanalysis_example Example tool
 *
 *  The binary analysis capabilities can be demonstrated by writing a simple example program that will read a specimen and create
 *  a human-readable pseudo-disassembly. This example will also demonstrate:
 *
 *  @li The diagnostic output subsystem
 *  @li Command-line parsing
 *  @li Generation of version-specific documentation
 *  @li The ability to parse a variety of containers
 *  @li The ability to decode a variety of instruction sets
 *  @li Configuring an unparser to generate output
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_headers Header files
 *
 *  ROSE header files follow these design principles:
 *
 *  @li The directory path of the header file mirrors the namespace hierarchy of the ROSE library. For instance, the header file for
 *  the class @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::BasicBlock has the path "Rose/BinaryAnalysis/Partitioner2".
 *
 *  @li The name of the header file matches the name of the entity it primarily declares. For instance, the header file for the @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::BasicBlock "BasicBlock" class in the @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2 namespace is
 *  named "BasicBlock.h".
 *
 *  @li Header files corresponding to a C++ namespace recursively include headers for everything within that namespace. For
 *  instance, including the \"Rose/BinaryAnalysis/Partitioner2.h\" header will recursively include header files for @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::BasicBlock, @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Function, @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine, etc. The ROSE library itself doesn't generally use namespace-level recursive headers
 *  since they increase compile times, but users are free to do so.
 *
 *  @li Header files named "BasicTypes.h" contain declarations most commonly needed as prerequisites for other header files, such
 *  as forward declarations for class names, definitions of shared pointer types, common enums, etc. As such, they can be compiled
 *  quickly.
 *
 *  @li Header files can be included in any order, and any number of times. They are deterministic and idempotent.
 *
 *  @note ROSE has not always followed these principles and therefore has legacy header files that violate them. None of these
 *  headers have paths that start with "Rose", and most of them are included with no path at all (or perhaps just lower-case "rose",
 *  depending on the build system and how ROSE was installed). One of these legacy headers is "rose.h". It was once necessary to
 *  include "rose.h" before any other header files, but this requirement has been relaxed for most headers under the "Rose"
 *  directory and all Sage "SgAsm*.h" headers for AST node types. If you get strange compile errors for things you don't think
 *  you're using, try adding `#include <rose.h>` to the top of your source code.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C rose include
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_namespaces Namespaces
 *
 *  It is customary to have C++ directives to help reduce the amount of typing for deeply nested ROSE data structures. This example
 *  will try to strike a balance between minimizing typing and using qualified names to help document the code for newcomers.
 *
 *  Namely, we will bring @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis into scope for the entire compilation unit as well as @ref
 *  Sawyer::Message::Common. The latter provides (among other things) the diagnostic message severity levels like @c FATAL, @c
 *  ERROR, @c WARN, @c INFO, and others. In addition, we abbreviate "Partitioner2" to just "P2" as is customary in many existing
 *  binary analysis tools.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C namespaces
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_diagnostics Diagnostics
 *
 *  ROSE has a @ref Rose::Diagnostics "subsystem" for emitting diagnostic messages and progress bars based on @ref Sawyer::Message.
 *  In short, line-oriented text messages are sent to @ref Sawyer::Message::Stream "streams" (subclass of @c std::ostream) of
 *  various severity levels ranging in severity from debug messages to fatal messages.  Streams for the severity levels are
 *  organized into @ref Sawyer::Message::Facility "facilities", one facility per ROSE component. For instance, the various @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Debugger "debuggers" all share one facility. The facilities are collected into one encompassing
 *  @ref Sawyer::Message::Facilities object from which they can all be controlled.
 *
 *  @note Facilities in ROSE are usually named `mlog` so that at any point in ROSE the name `mlog` refers to the inner,
 *  most-specific facility according to the usual C++ name resolution rules.
 *
 *  Our example tool creates a message facility named `mlog` at file scope.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C mlog decl
 *
 *  A diagnostic message facility needs to be initialized at runtime, which we do near the top of our `main` function. In fact,
 *  the ROSE library itself needs to also be initialized, and we use the @c ROSE_INITIALIZE macro for this which also checks
 *  certain things, like that the ROSE header files that have been included match the version used to compiled the ROSE library
 *  (to adhere to the [C++ ODR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule)).
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C init
 *
 *  Individual streams can be turned on or off in source code with their @ref Sawyer::Message::Stream::enable "enable"
 *  functions. The ROSE binary analysis tools also have a "--log" switch to query and control the various streams. To get
 *  started, use "--log=help". For example, here's our example tool listing all known diagnostic facilities and what streams
 *  within each facility are enabled (our own tool's facility is listed last):
 *
 *  ```console
 *  $ ./example --log=list
 *  Logging facilities status
 *    Letters indicate a stream that is enabled; hyphens indicate disabled.

 *  If we wanted to enable all diagnostic output from our tool, and only errors and fatal diagnostics from the rest of ROSE, we
 *  could invoke our tool like this, which first disables all streams, then enables those for errors and greater, and finally

 *
 *  ```console

 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_cmdline Command-line parsing
 *
 *  ROSE binary analysis tools use the @ref Sawyer::CommandLine API for parsing switches and their arguments from the command-line
 *  in order to give a consistent look and feel across all tools. Parsing the positional arguments following the switches is up to
 *  each individual tool, although many tools can simply feed these to any of the ROSE functions responsible for loading a binary
 *  specimen for analysis. Because the switch grammar is known by ROSE but the positional argument grammar is not, it is impossible
 *  for ROSE to interleave these two grammars in a sound way. Therefore all command-line arguments to be treated as switches by ROSE
 *  parser must occur before any other command-line arguments to be parsed by the tool.
 *
 *  A command-line switch parser is built from individual @ref Sawyer::CommandLine::Switch "switch definitions", the switch
 *  definitions are combined to form @ref Sawyer::CommandLine::SwitchGroup "switch groups", and the switch groups are combined
 *  to form a @ref Sawyer::CommandLine::Parser "switch parser". All of these parts are copyable; for instance, a switch definition
 *  is copied when inserted into a switch group.
 *
 *  A switch parser is also responsible for creating the Unix "man" page documentation that describes the command-line switches and
 *  the workings of the tool. Documentation is written in a very simple language consisting of paragraphs separated by blank lines.
 *  A variety of paragraph types are possible (plain, bulleted lists, named lists, quoted text, etc.) and spans of characters within
 *  a paragraph can have styles (plain, variable, emphasized, code, etc). Due to limitations in the ways that man pages are
 *  generated, certain restrictions apply, such as the inability to nest lists.
 *
 *  The example tool creates a new switch group whose switch names can be optionally prefixed with "tool" if they need to be
 *  disambiguated from other ROSE switches (as in "--tool:output"). A "--output" or "-o" switch is added to this group and takes
 *  a single argument that can be any string. After a successful parse of the command-line switches, the argument will be saved
 *  in the @c settings.outputFileName variable. The documentation string demonstrates a single paragraph that makes reference to
 *  the (arbitrary) name of the switch argument.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C switch defn
 *
 *  The man page for this switch, generated from `./example --help` looks like this,
 *  automatically reflowed to the width of the terminal.
 *
 *  ```text
 *  Tool-specific switches
 *      --[tool:]output filename; -o filename
 *          Write the assembly listing to the specified file. If the filename
 *          is "-" then output is send to the standard output stream.
 *  ```
 *
 *  @note Due to limitations of the ROSE documentation system, what you don't see here is that the word "filename"  (all three
 *  occurrences) is underlined to indicate it's a variable, and that the heading is in a bold font face.
 *
 *  Once the tool switch groups (in this case just one) are defined, we can create a parser and add that group to it. ROSE's
 *  command-line parsing is very modular, allowing us to also add a group of standard, generic switches before the tool
 *  switches. We also place a "Synopsis" section in the man page, and tell the parser that if it encounters an error it should
 *  emit an error message using our @c FATAL diagnostic stream.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C switch parser
 *
 *  The ROSE binary analysis tools have a policy of defining the single-line purpose and multi-line description at the very top of
 *  the source file where it's easily discovered.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C description
 *
 *  Up to this point, we have only defined the parser. Later/below we will show how the parser is used.
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_partitioning Partitioning
 *
 *  ROSE calls the process of distinguishing between instructions and static data, and organizing the instructions into basic blocks
 *  and functions "partitioning". Since some forms of binary specimens can arbitrarily mix code and data and don't have enough
 *  information to distinguish between them, the general partitioning problem is undecidable. ROSE uses certain heuristics to
 *  guess the partitioning, and in most cases these heuristics produce good results.
 *
 *  Partitioning is performed in ROSE with the @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2 API, which primarily consists of a number of
 *  different @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine "engines" that interface with and store results in a @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Partitioner "partitioner". The partitioner is subsequently used by many other parts of ROSE
 *  during analysis and unparsing.
 *
 *  Different kinds of binary specimens require different kinds of partitioning approaches. For instance, byte code is often packed
 *  in a container from which the code and data can be easily and accurately discovered, while general machine code requires a much
 *  more involved heuristic approach for an ultimately undecidable problem. These approaches are encoded in partitioning engines
 *  like @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::EngineBinary "EngineBinary" and @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::EngineJvm
 *  "EngineJvm", each of which take different command-line switches. A tool must surmount the
 *  [chicken-versus-egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) problem of being able to parse the command-line switches,
 *  producing documentation, and configuring an engine before knowing what engine is ultimately required. The specifics are
 *  documented in the @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine "engine" base class, but in general the steps are:
 *
 *  @li Create a command-line switch parser without engine-specific switches (presented above).
 *  @li Produce a man page that describes all available engines.
 *  @li Attempt to parse switches with each engine in order to get the the positional arguments.
 *  @li Parse the positional arguments in a tool-specific manner to get the specimen description arguments.
 *  @li Test whether the engine can handle the specimen description arguments.
 *  @li If so, adjust the user-supplied parser by adding that engine's command-lines switches.
 *  @li Return the suitable engine for the tool to use later.
 *
 *  These steps are all performed with two function calls from the tool. One to find the correct engine and another to process the
 *  command-line using the adjusted parser. Command-line parsing has two parts: the actual parsing and verification of the
 *  command-line syntax, and then applying the parse results to update the C++ switch argument destination variables that were noted
 *  when the parser was built, namely our `Settings settings` variable in `main` and the settings in the @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine "engine" that was returned. For this reason, the locations bound to the parser must
 *  outlive the call to @ref Sawyer::CommandLine::ParserResult::apply "apply".
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C engine config
 *
 *  After parsing the command-line switches, the tool obtains the non-switch, positional arguments by calling @ref
 *  Sawyer::CommandLine::ParserResult::unreachedArgs "unreachedArgs" and we check them to see that a specimen was actually given on
 *  the command-line. The tool also emits some information about what engine is being used.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C arg check
 *
 *  Finally, the tool runs the partitioning engine by calling its @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine::partition
 *  "partition" method with the specimen description positional arguments from the command-line. The tool's man page ("--help")
 *  describes at length the different ways to describe a binary specimen, and ROSE supports parsing containers like ELF, PE and java
 *  class files and initializing virtual analysis memory from their segment/section descriptions and/or initializing memory in other
 *  ways: from raw memory dumps, from Motorola S-Records, from Intel HEX files, from running Linux processes, by creating a Linux
 *  process and interrupting it, from ELF core dumps, from previously saved ROSE Binary Analysis (RBA) files, from data bytes
 *  specified on the command-line, or from custom-designed formats. Additionally, parts of the address space can be subsequently
 *  adjusted such as setting or clearing access permissions, or erasing parts of the space. Ultimately, what gets created at this
 *  step before the core partitioning algorithms run is a virtual address space represented by a @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::MemoryMap object.
 *
 *  The partitioning process can be controlled at a finer granularity, but the most common approach is to call @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Engine::partition and do everything at once. The result is a @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Partitioner "Partitioner" object that holds information that later analyses can obtain
 *  efficiently, such as the virtual memory map and the processor architecture.
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C partition
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_pointers Shared-ownership pointers
 *
 *  This is a good time to mention the various @c Ptr types already encountered in this example. ROSE binary analysis objects are
 *  mostly allocated on the heap and accessed through reference counting pointers. These objects are not created with the usual
 *  C++ constructors (which have been made protected to prevent accidental misuse), but rather with static member functions usually
 *  named @c instance. Therefore, calls to the @c new and @c delete operators are almost never encountered in ROSE binary analysis
 *  tools and memory errors are less likely. The type @c ConstPtr is a shared-ownership pointer to a @c const object.
 *
 *  The reason that the pointer types have these names is twofold. It's shorter to write `Foo::Ptr` than to write
 *  `std::shared_ptr<Foo>`, but mainly because ROSE uses three kinds of shared-ownership pointers:
 *
 *  @li `std::shared_ptr<T>` is used for the majority of most recently-written parts of ROSE.
 *  @li `boost::shared_ptr<T>` is used for most legacy parts of ROSE before C++11 was available.
 *  @li @ref Sawyer::SharedPointer is a type of intrusive pointer used where performance is critical.
 *
 *  All of these pointers support the usual pointer-like operations of dereferencing with `operator*` and `operator->`, assignment
 *  from compatible pointers with `operator=`, and testing whether the pointer is null with `explicit operator bool`.
 *
 *  When only forward declarations are present (when you only include "BasicTypes.h" header files), the pointer types are juxtaposed
 *  with the class name, as in `FooPtr` and `FooConstPtr` versus `Foo::Ptr` and `Foo::ConstPtr`. The binary analysis convention is
 *  that the juxtaposed names are used in header files (and thus most documentation) and the separate names are used everywhere
 *  else. This convention enables header files to have fewer dependencies.
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_types Other special types
 *
 *  One thing to notice with binary analysis is that the C++ signed integral types are almost never used; only unsigned types are
 *  used. This is because most modern arithmetic machine instructions operate on unsigned values, and relatively few arithmetic
 *  instructions need to make a distinction between signed and unsigned operation. Because of this, subtraction in a two's
 *  complement paradigm is usually accomplished by overflow of unsigned addition.
 *
 *  Another reason for using almost exclusively unsigned types is that binary specimens routinely have values near the high end of
 *  the unsigned range, and even values like 32-bit `0xffffffff` is common. This tidbit is one reason ROSE has its own @ref
 *  Sawyer::Container::Interval "interval" types that store the interval's maximum value instead of the more usual C++
 *  one-after-the-end value, and why binary analysis tends to use intervals instead of size (e.g., the size of (number of values
 *  in) an interval that spans the entire domain is one larger than can be represented in that domain).
 *
 *  One important thing to be aware of for C++ signed integral values is that the compiler can assume that signed overflow is not
 *  possible, and if it actually occurs the behavior is [undefined](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub). The C++ compiler
 *  is not required to diagnose the undefined behavior nor is the compiled program required to do anything meaningful.
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanaysis_example_unparse Unparsing
 *
 *  Unparsing means two things in ROSE binary analysis: recreating the specimen from ROSE's (possibly modified) intermediate
 *  representation (IR), and producing an assembly listing. Although it is possible to modify the IR to produce a new specimen,
 *  doing so is generally unsound because not only is the partitioning undecidable, but also because a binary generally doesn't
 *  have enough information to adjust all cross-references to moved code and data (or for that matter, to even know about all
 *  the cross references).
 *
 *  Therefore, unparsing in the context of binary analysis usually means unparsing the IR to an assembly code representation. ROSE,
 *  being a library to aid human understanding of binaries and because of the undecidability of partitioning in the first place, has
 *  it's own assembly format that's not necessarily intended to be reassembled into a binary. To that end, ROSE's syntax is more
 *  uniform across instruction sets, and often more verbose than the typical assembler for that architecture. ROSE does, however,
 *  generally preserve native instruction mnemonics and operand order.
 *
 *  ROSE's unparser is a hierarchy of classes fully extensible by the user in their own tools at compile time. These unparsers are
 *  highly configurable yet creating a specialized unparser is very simple. An unparser can:
 *
 *  @li unparse a single instruction, a basic block, a single function, or an entire specimen
 *  @li produce colorized output with ANSI escape codes
 *  @li show reasons why ROSE thinks code exists at certain addresses
 *  @li show static data as bytes and/or decoded machine instructions not part of control flow
 *  @li show a representation of the function call graph in the function headers
 *  @li show control flow information as comments and as margin arrows
 *  @li show descriptions for each instruction mnemonic to aid understanding of uncommon instruction sets
 *  @li show signed and unsigned decimal values
 *  @li comment on various parts of instruction operand expressions
 *  @li show raw addresses or only generated basic block labels
 *  @li show machine instruction bytes
 *  @li show how instructions are organized into basic blocks
 *  @li show stack pointer offset from the beginning of the function
 *  @li show detected calling conventions and argument usage
 *  @li show user-defined information by extending the unparser through class derivation
 *
 *  An easy way to unparse a single instruction without leveraging all the power of a full unparser, is to call the instruction's
 *  @ref SgAsmInstruction::toString "toString" method.  But this example, because it wants to unparse an entire specimen, obtains
 *  a suitable unparser for the specimen's architecture and then calls its @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Unparser::Base::unparse
 *  "unparse" method. The `outputFile` function is defined in the example tool to return a `std::ostream` reference based on the
 *  argument to the "--output" command-line switch (if any).
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} disassembler.C unparse
 *
 *  @note ROSE also has a legacy unparser framework which is being phased out. It's defined in "src/backend/asmUnparser" in the
 *  class @c Rose::BinaryAnalysis::AsmUnaprser (intentionally not cross referenced here since you shouldn't use it).
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_arch Architecture abstraction
 *
 *  You may have noticed the call(s) to obtain an architecture. ROSE abstracts most architecture-specific information and algorithms
 *  into classes derived from @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Architecture::Base. A number of these architectures are built into the ROSE
 *  library, but users can also define their own architectures and register them using the functions in the @ref
 *  Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Architecture namespace. In fact, the user's architecture definition can be compiled into its own library
 *  and made available to standard ROSE tools at runtime with their "--architectures" switch.
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_listing Full listing
 *
 *  Here is the full listing of the example program with cross references.
 *
 *  @includelineno disassembler.C
 *
 *  @subsection rose_binaryanalysis_example_compiling Compiling
 *
 *  To compile this program you'll want to use the same compiler, preprocessor switches, compiler switches, and loader switches
 *  as are used when compiling ROSE.  This is important since C++ has no official, documented application binary interface.
 *  Mixing libraries compiled with different C++ compilers, compiler versions, compiler optimization levels, or even other
 *  seemingly benign compiler switches is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 *  When ROSE is installed, a text file describing the compiler is also installed. Depending on the installation mechanism, this
 *  file has one of the following names w.r.t. the root of the ROSE installation:
 *
 *  @li "include/rose-installed-make.cfg" is a "key=value" format file using GNU make syntax. This file also contains the ROSE
 *  license and a list of software dependencies and their versions.
 *
 *  @li "include/rose-installed-shell.cfg" is a "key=value" format file using Bourne shell syntax. This is generally compatible
 *  with most other command shells. This file also contains the ROSE license and a list of software dependencies and their versions.
 *
 *  @li "lib/rose-config.cfg" is a "key=value" format file using GNU make syntax and some of the variables are different than the
 *  other two files. It also does not contain the license or the software dependency list.
 *
 *  Although the above example is part of the ROSE library and is compiled when the library is built, in general a project will need
 *  it's own build system. Projects officially sanctioned by the ROSE team must follow the project requirements outlined on the ROSE
 *  internal wiki. Users are free to design their build system to do whatever they want, but using the example project from ROSE
 *  itself is a good starting point. You can find the example on
 *  [GitHub](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/tree/weekly/tools/PortabilityTesting/lib/matrix/test-project). */
