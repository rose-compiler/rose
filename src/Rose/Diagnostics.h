/** Controls diagnostic messages from ROSE.
 *
 *  ROSE uses the free [Sawyer](http://github.com/matzke1/sawyer) library to emit diagnostic messages for events such as
 *  debugging, program tracing, informational messages, warning and error messages, progress reports, and runtime logic
 *  assertions. The Sawyer message support can be found in the Sawyer::Message name space in "Sawyer/Message.h", and the
 *  run-time logic assertions can be found in the Sawyer::Assert name space in "assert/Assert.h" (which also defines a number
 *  of C preprocessor macros whose names begin with "ASSERT_".
 *
 *  To this API more ROSE-like, we create some aliases. Unfortunately these aliases aren't entirely understood by Doxygen, so we
 *  list them here:
 *
 *  @li @c Rose::Diagnostics::Facility is an alias of @ref Sawyer::Message::Facility
 *  @li @c Rose::Diagnostics::Stream is an alias of @ref Sawyer::Message::Stream
 *  @li @c Rose::Diagnostics::mfacilities is an alias of @ref Sawyer::Message::mfacilities
 *
 *  Sawyer supports multiple instances of messaging facilities (@ref Sawyer::Message::Facility, a.k.a.,
 *  `Rose::Diagnostics::Facility` each of which defines a `std::ostream` object for each of a number of message importance levels.
 *  ROSE defines one global library-wide facility, @ref Rose::Diagnostics::mlog whose string name (used in output) is simply "rose".
 *  Software layers within ROSE may define their own facilities and give them names indicative of the software layer, like
 *  `Rose::BinaryAnalysis::StackDelta`. Tools that use ROSE can also define and register their own facilities.  All these facilities
 *  are then grouped together into a single @ref Sawyer::Message::Facilities object (a.k.a., `Rose::Diagnostics::mfacilities`), so
 *  they can be controlled collectively or individually from the ROSE command-line (e.g., the `frontend` call).
 *
 * @section diagnostics_cmdline_usage Command-line usage
 *
 *  ROSE looks for the command-line switch (e.g., "-rose:log" for source analysis tools or "--log" for binary analysis tools) that
 *  takes one argument: @em what.  If @em what is the word "help" then usage information is displayed; if @em what is the word
 *  "list" then log settings are displayed.  Otherwise, @em what is expected to be a string to pass to the @ref
 *  Sawyer::Message::mfacilities (@c Rose::Diagnostics::mfacilities.control) function.  See the output from any tool that supports
 *  "--log help" for details about the syntax.
 *
 * @section diagnostics_in_rose Adding a facility to ROSE
 *
 *  Note: this section is about adding a new logging facility to the ROSE library proper. Adding a facility to a tool that uses
 *  ROSE is simpler and is described in a later section.
 *
 *  As an example, let's say that a programmer wants to convert the BinaryLoader class to use its own logging facilities.  The
 *  first step is to declare a static data member for the facility. Adding a logging facility to a namespace or file is similar
 *  except the @c mlog would be declared in the namespace or as a file-scope (static or anonymous namespace) variable.
 *
 * @code
 *  // in BinaryLoader.h
 *  #include <Rose/Diagnostics.h>
 *
 *  class BinaryLoader {
 *      ...
 *  protected:
 *      static Rose::Diagnostics::Facility mlog; // a.k.a., Sawyer::Message::Facility
 *  };
 * @endcode
 *
 *  If we consistently name message facilities "mlog" then any unqualified reference to @c mlog in the source code will
 *  probably be the most appropriate (most narrowly scoped) facility.  Adding a new facility to a software component that
 *  already uses the rose-wide "mlog" is mostly a matter of defining a more narrowly scoped @c mlog, and the existing code will
 *  start using it (you probably also need to search for places where @c mlog usage was qualified). Specifically, we avoid
 *  using "log" as the name of any logging facility because it can conflict on some systems with the logorithm function @c log.
 *
 *  The second step is to define the @c mlog static variable. Since the variable is statically allocated, it must be
 *  constructed only with the default constructor. Sawyer also has other Facility constructors, but these generally can't be
 *  used for static variables because there is no portable way to ensure that the C++ runtime is initialized before the
 *  Facility initialization happens.  If the initializations occur in the wrong order then bizarre behavior may result,
 *  including segmentation faults in STL container classes.
 *
 * @code
 *  // in BinaryLoader.C
 *  #include <Rose/BinaryAnalysis/BinaryLoader.h>
 *  Rose::Diagnostics::Facility BinaryLoader::mlog;
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The third step is to initialize the @c mlog static variable after we're sure that the C++ runtime has been initialized. We
 *  can do this by defining a class method (a.k.a., static function member) that can be called from ROSE's initialization
 *  phase.  This is the point at which the mlog is given a name and connected to a destination(s).  The name is usually the
 *  fully qualified name of the component for which the @c mlog object serves as the logging facility, and may contain typical
 *  C++ symbol names, dots, and "::".  This name is used to enable/disable the facility from the command-line, and will show up
 *  as part of the output for any message emitted using this facility.  It is recommended that you also provide a comment in
 *  order to help people that are not ROSE developers to use ROSE-based tools. The comment should start with a gerund (verb
 *  ending with "ing"), be uncapitalized, and unpunctuated.
 *
 *  The second, optional half of this step is to register the facility with the ROSE library so it can be controlled from the
 *  command-line. Although unregistered facilities are still useful, components of the ROSE library should almost always
 *  register their facility. The easiest way to do this consistently is to use @ref initAndRegister like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  // class method (static member function) in BinaryLoader.C
 *  void BinaryLoader::initDiagnostics() {
 *      static bool initialized = false;
 *      if (!initialized) {
 *          initialized = true;
 *          Diagnostics::initAndRegister(&mlog, "Rose::BinaryAnalysis::BinaryLoader");
 *          mlog.comment("mapping files into virtual memory");
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  If the class, namespace, or file containing you @c initDiagnostics function is conditionally compiled (e.g., binary
 *  analysis is not always enabled in ROSE), you'll want to add a dummy version of @c initDiagnostics that does nothing
 *  (preferrable to using conditional compilation in the next step).
 *
 *  The fourth and final step is to add a call to `BinaryLoader::initDiagnostics` from @ref Diagnostics::initialize. This function
 *  is defined in "src/roseSupport/Diagnostics.C". You probably don't need to include your entire header file in Diagnostics.C; a
 *  declarations should be sufficient and faster to compile.
 *
 * @section diagnostics_in_tools Adding a facility to a tool
 *
 *  Tools that are built on top of the ROSE library can use the same Sawyer messaging support, and the tool's Facility objects
 *  can be registered with ROSE and thus controlled along with the library's facilities.  Doing so is even easier than using
 *  the facility in part of the ROSE library: declare the facility, and initialize and register it.  Tools can create as many
 *  facilities as they like, although the description below assumes only one.
 *
 *  The facility is usually declared as a static object so it can be available to all parts of the tool.  As with static
 *  facilities in the ROSE library itself (described above), it should be only default constructed.  Also, instead of using
 *  namespace @ref Rose::Diagnostics, the tool can optionally use namespace @ref Sawyer::Message::Common.  This avoids the
 *  ambiguity for @c mlog that would be created by importing @ref Rose::Diagnostics or @ref Sawyer::Message (the types and
 *  enums in these two namespaces are equivalent).
 *
 * @code
 *  #include <Rose/Diagnostics.h>
 *  using namespace Sawyer::Message::Common; // if you want unqualified DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, etc.
 *  Sawyer::Message::Facility mlog; // a.k.a., Rose::Diagnostics::Facility
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The second step, initialization and registration, is usually near the beginning of @c main right after initializing the
 *  ROSE library but before command-line processing.
 *
 * @code
 *  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *      ROSE_INITIALIZE;
 *      mlog = Rose::Diagnostics::initAndRegister(&mlog, "name-of-my-tool");
 * @endcode
 *
 *  If you want to globally adjust which levels of diagnostics are output by default (later modified by the command-line) you
 *  can do that by passing a string to the same function that's used by the command-line processing, such as:
 *
 * @code
 *  Sawyer::Message::mfacilities.control("none,>=info");
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Although initialization is required, the registering step is optional. Registering causes the tool's diagnostics to be
 *  conrollable from ROSE's command-line switches.  If you want to only initialize and not register, then use this:
 *
 * @code
 *  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *      ROSE_INITIALIZE;
 *      mlog = Sawyer::Message::Facility("name-of-my-tool", Rose::Diagnostics::destination);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section diagnostics_facility_usage Using a facility in the ROSE library or tools
 *
 *  When using a message facility within the ROSE library source code, it is generally desirable to have a "using namespace
 *  Rose::Diagnostics" in effect.  Not only does this alleviate the need to qualify the important levels (e.g., `INFO`, `WARN`,
 *  etc), but it also brings @ref Rose::Diagnostics::mlog, the library-wide logging facility, into scope.  Doing so will allow any
 *  software component to perform logging using the library-wide facility, and once a more local @c mlog is declared the more local
 *  symbol is automatically used.
 *
 *  When using a message facility within a tool, importing the @ref Sawyer::Message::Common instead of @ref Rose::Diagnostics
 *  will prevent an ambiguity between the tool's global @c mlog and @ref Rose::Diagnostics::mlog. You can do which ever you
 *  prefer.
 *
 *  Regardless of whether you're writing a ROSE library component or a tool, all one needs to do to use a facility is to write
 *  a C++ std::ostream-style output statement whose left-hand operand is a @ref Sawyer::Message::Stream.  Since streams are
 *  held in a @ref Sawyer::Message::Facility and since facilities usually have the C++ name "mlog", the statement will look
 *  something like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  using Rose::Diagnostics; // or using Sawyer::Message::Common
 *  mlog[INFO] <<"loading \"" <<filename <<"\"\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The default configuration will cause the message to be emitted on the standard error stream along with information about
 *  the name of the executable, the thread ID, the time in seconds relative to the start of the process, the name of the
 *  facility, and the message importance.  For example:
 *
 * @code
 *  identityTranslator[30603] 0.00949s BinaryLoader[INFO]: loading "/usr/lib32/libc.so"
 * @endcode
 *
 *  ROSE also defines a global macro @c mprintf that is a drop-in replacement for @c printf.  This macro uses whatever `mlog[DEBUG]`
 *  is in scope.  The @ref mfprintf function can be used as a replacement when a specific logging stream is desired.
 *
 *  Sometimes one wants the right hand side of the output statements to be evaluated only in certain circumstances for
 *  performance reasons, and there are multiple ways to do that.  If you already use conditional compilation or "if" statements
 *  to generate diagnostic output, continue to do the same.  You can also use an "if" statement whose condition is the
 *  diagnostic stream since streams evaluated in a Boolean context return true or false depending on whether the stream is
 *  enabled or disabled:
 *
 * @code
 *  if (mlog[INFO])
 *      mlog[INFO] <<"loading \"" <<filename <<"\"\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Sawyer also has a SAWYER_MESG() macro that's used like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  SAWER_MESG(mlog[INFO]) <<"loading \"" <<filename <<"\"\n";
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Another thing you can do is construct a new locally-declared stream with a shorter name.  Some parts of the ROSE library do
 *  things like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  using namespace Rose::Diagnostics;
 *  void doSomething() {
 *      Stream debug(mlog[DEBUG]); // get our own copy of a stream
 *      ...
 *      if (debug) {
 *          some_debugging_things();
 *          debug <<"debugging results...\n";
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Not only does this reduce typing a little, but since the function is using its own private message stream, partial messages
 *  emitted to that stream won't interfere with partial messages emitted to `mlog[DEBUG]` by called functions (see next section).
 *
 *  Another debugging trick is to create a local stream like above, and then explicitly enable or disable it based on some
 *  condition you're trying to debug:
 *
 * @code
 *  using namespace Rose::Diagnostics;
 *  void doSomething(int foo) {
 *      Stream debug(mlog[DEBUG]); // get our own copy of a stream
 *      debug.enable(5==foo); // enable it only in certain cases
 *      ...
 *      if (debug) {
 *          some_debugging_things();
 *          debug <<"debugging results...\n";
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section diagnostics_partial Partial messages
 *
 *  A partial message is any message for which the linefeed, "\n", hasn't been inserted.  If a message stream is unbuffered and
 *  another message is emitted to a different stream and ends up going to the same ultimate destination (e.g., standard error),
 *  then any previous partial message is interrupted, usually by appending "...", and re-emitted later when more text is added.
 *
 *  Since each message stream creates messages sequentially in an incremental manner, we sometimes want to "save" a partial
 *  message, allow other messages to be emitted from the same stream, and then complete the original message later.  This most
 *  often happens when one function creates a partial message, and then calls another function that might use the same stream
 *  before the partial message is completed.  The best way to accomplish this is by creating a new, temporary message stream
 *  and moving any partial messages to the new stream.  The copy constructor can be used, like the example above, but even more
 *  conveniently, if the source stream in the copy constructor has an outstanding partial message then that partial message is
 *  moved (not copied) to the newly constructed stream.  This allows a partial message to be emitted in the same statement that
 *  constructs the local stream:
 *
 * @code
 *  Stream m1(mlog[INFO] <<"loading \"" <<filename <<"\""); //note no "\n"
 *  Sawyer::Stopwatch timer;
 *  do_other_stuff_that_might_emit_info_messages();
 *  m1 <<"; took " <<timer <<"\n"; //original message completed now
 *  // you may continue to use m1 for additional messages...
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The documentation for @ref Sawyer::Message has additional hints and examples.
 *
 * @section diagnostics_prefix Diagnostic prefix
 *
 *  Each diagnostic message has a prefix that contains, by default, the process ID and time, among other things. Sometimes
 *  this information should be suppressed in order to more easily compare diagnostic messages between tools. This can be
 *  done by adjusting the @ref Rose::Diagnostics::mprefix, which is a pointer to a @ref Sawyer::Message::Prefix object. The
 *  adjustments should be done after the ROSE library is initialized (e.g., via ROSE_INITIALIZE, normally the first thing
 *  in "main").
 *
 * @section diagnostics_destinations Sending output to other locations
 *
 *  Diagnostic output always goes to standard error by default in ROSE and ROSE-based tools.  If you want to send your tool's
 *  output to a file instead, you can do something like follows instead of the usual call to @ref Rose::Diagnostics::initAndRegister.
 *
 * @code
 *  // double quotes are represented by &quote; to work around bugs in doxygen 1.9.8
 *  std::ofstream output(&quote;tool-errors.txt&quote); // must remain open for duration of run
 *  Sawyer::Message::DestinationPtr destination = Sawyer::Message::StreamSink::instance(output, Rose::Diagnostics::mprefix);
 *  mlog = Facility(&quote;tool&quote;, destination); // your tool's global diagnostic facility
 *  Sawyer::Message::mfacilities.insertAndAdjust(mlog); // so it can be controled by ROSE's command-line processing
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Be sure to flush the file by closing it explicitly or implicitly since we didn't configure it to be unbuffered or line
 *  buffered. Failure to do any of these steps could result in your file not actually getting any diagnostic messages.
