This directory implements the details of the SageIII IR used in ROSE.

Documentation for lexical preprocessing step called by ROSE to collect
list of comments, preprocessor directives, and recently the token 
stream.

preproc.lex:
First version was written by Markus Shordan (preproc.lex).
This version collected comments and CPP directives only.

preproc.lex.1-13-2007:
Second version by Rama. This version fixed some regular
expressions, buffer handling problems, and represented
a rewrite of the first version of the code (preproc.lex)

preproc.lex.5-10-2007:
Third version by Rama.  This version fixes comment handling,
better matching construct handling, keyword handling (with 
techniques developed in Fortran preprocessor) and has a lot
of C and C++ techniques which will provide for better 
lexical processing of C and C++.

**********************************************************************

A number of important C++ files are automatically generated, by ROSETTA.
These are placed into the compile tree (we generally assume that there
is both a source tree and a compile tree and that they are different).
Generated files include (complete list as of 5/27/2007):

   Cxx_Grammar.h and Cxx_Grammar.C
      Implementation of IR node classes, member functions, and supporting declarations and
      definitions.

   Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalAccessEnums.h
      Generation of enum values used in the synthesized attributes and in 
      tests against the variant (see get_variantT() function in documentation).

   Cxx_GrammarNewConstructors.C
      Implementation of constructors (new style, without Sg_File_Info objects which are
      meant to be set separately)

   Cxx_GrammarReturnDataMemberPointers.C
      Generated function that returns child pointers all child IR nodes.

   Cxx_GrammarReturnDataMemberReferenceToPointers.C
      Generated function that returns references to all child IR node pointers.

   Cxx_GrammarTraverseMemoryPool.C
      Generated memory pool traversal (see tutorial for details of memory pool traversals)

   Cxx_GrammarCopyMemberFunctions.C
      Generated function to copy IR nodes (deep, shallow, and custom levels of copying are
      supported)

   Cxx_GrammarNewAndDeleteOperators.C
      Generated new and delete operators (implements memory pools for each IR class).

   Cxx_GrammarCheckingIfDataMembersAreInMemoryPool.C
      Generated functions for checking if data members are in the memory pool (since they 
      could in theory be on the stack or in global scope etc. and we only support fast 
      file I/O for those in the heap).  In practice all IR nodes are in the heap, but it
      is possible for users to not do so and so this is the test to support these details
      in the AST file I/O.

   Cxx_GrammarVariantEnumNames.C
      Generated global variable (roseGlobalVariantNameList) holding array of strings of
      all class names.

   Cxx_GrammarRTI.C
      Generated support for Runtime Type Interface (usually called RTTI).

   Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalSuccessorContainer.C
      Generated function to compute list of child IR nodes in the strictly defined AST
      (this is a subset of all references to IR nodes defined by function generated in
      Cxx_GrammarReturnDataMemberPointers.C and Cxx_GrammarReturnDataMemberReferenceToPointers.C).

   Cxx_GrammarGetChildIndex.C
      More generated functions supporting the AST file I/O.  These generate the functions
      to support computation of unique index values in to the global memory pool of all IR
      nodes.  These are called in a way that makes there semantics unclear.

**********************************************************************

Here we summarize the separate sub-directoies of this directory:

   astCommentsAndCppSupport
      This is the support for extraction of comments and preprocessor control directives
      (it includes the support for using Wave as well).

   astHiddenTypeAndDeclarationLists
      This is the implementation of the generation of list of symbols in each scope
      associated with: hidden types, hidden declarations, and types requiring type
      elaboration. Each case is held in a separate list in each scope. This work
      supports the name qualification within the unparser (code generation).

   astFileIO
      This is the support for binary file I/O on the AST (much of which is generated code).

   astFixup
      This is the location of code which makes corrections to the AST after construction.
      Most of these eventually make there way into the generation of the AST so that is 
      does not need to be fixed up afterward, but some are either implemented here or
      are placed here and fixed in the generation of the AST later.

   astPostProcessing
      This is the implementation of added post processing of the AST to compute things
      that are not possible or difficult to compute during construction of the AST.
      Some template details are of this sort and handled here, and compete list is
      in the postProcessingSupport() function in the astPostProcessing.C file.

   astMerge
      This implements the merging of separate ASTs (typically from different files of the
      same program, but could be different programs).

   astTokenStream
      This is the support for weaving of the preprocessed token stream (the post processed
      token stream is the one generated from cpp preprocessing).

   astVisualization
      This is the support for visualization of either the AST or the whole graph
      representing the AST with all symbols, types, etc.  The strict AST does not
      include such IR nodes as they are considered attributes to an AST.  The graphs of
      the whole graph associated with the AST are useful for internal debugging or
      for understanding complex relations between IR nodes (not represented in the
      simpler graph of just the AST).

   docs
      This is the location of doxygen documentation (the input files for doxygen).
      These are copied form the ROSE/docs/testDoxygen directory where the originals
      are located and developed.

   sageInterface
      These are functions that support all different levels of support on the SageIII
      AST used in ROSE.  The functions here don't make sense to include in the
      automatically generated functions (built in Cxx_Grammar.C and other files).
      Users should consider looking here before they resort to implementing their
      own supporting functions for operating on the AST.

   virtualCFG
      This is the implementation of a stateless control flow graph threaded onto the AST.
      It is particularly convinent basis for other forms of analysis using the control
      flow graph.


# Rasmussen (04/17/2019): Support for ATerms has been deprecated.  The following notes
# may be useful to help debug its removal. Function build_node_from_nonlist_children has
# been removed.

Aterm support notes:
   1) Function declated in generated header ROSE IR files:
static SgTemplateParameter* 
build_node_from_nonlist_children(
   SgTemplateParameter::template_parameter_enum parameterType = parameter_undefined, 
   SgType* type = NULL, 
   SgType* defaultTypeParameter = NULL, 
   SgExpression* expression = NULL, 
   SgExpression* defaultExpressionParameter = NULL, 
   SgDeclarationStatement* templateDeclaration = NULL, 
   SgDeclarationStatement* defaultTemplateDeclarationParameter = NULL, 
   SgInitializedName* initializedName = NULL); 

// Function used in generated source file for aterm support:
returnNode = 
SgTemplateParameter::build_node_from_nonlist_children(
   local_expression, 
   local_defaultExpressionParameter, 
   local_templateDeclaration, 
   local_defaultTemplateDeclarationParameter, 
   local_initializedName); 


The bug is that I am missing:
   SgTemplateParameter::template_parameter_enum parameterType = parameter_undefined, 
   SgType* type = NULL, 
   SgType* defaultTypeParameter = NULL, 

These are used in the SgTemplateParameter constructor in the EDG/ROSE translation.
There is no build function in the SageBuilder namespace.

returnNode = 
SgTemplateParameter::build_node_from_nonlist_children(
   local_type, 
   local_defaultTypeParameterlocal_expression, 
   local_defaultExpressionParameter, 
   local_templateDeclaration, 
   local_defaultTemplateDeclarationParameter, 
   local_initializedName); 

   2) There is nothing to say what the elements are of an IR node that has a container.
      So this has to be handled via some specific function that will be case oriented.
