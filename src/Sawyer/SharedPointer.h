/** Reference-counting intrusive smart pointer.
 *
 *  This class implements a reference-counting pointer to an object that inherits from @ref SharedObject. See @ref SharedObject
 *  for a detailed description of how to prepare objects to be referenced by @ref SharedPointer.
 *
 *  Usage is similar to @c std::shared_ptr to the extent that the number of pointers pointing to an object is recorded
 *  somewhere, and when that reference count reaches zero the object is destroyed and freed by calling @c delete. The main
 *  difference is that @ref SharedPointer stores the reference count in the object itself (i.e., "intrusive"). The effects
 *  are:
 *
 *  @li @ref SharedPointer is faster than non-intrusive reference-counting pointers like @c std::shared_ptr and @c
 *  boost::shared_ptr.
 *
 *  @li The concepts of weak pointers and unique pointers are not supported because there is no separate pointer group object.
 *
 *  @li A class is declared as either having a reference count (inheriting from @ref SharedObject) or not having a reference
 *  count (not inheriting). All objects that have such a built-in reference count are expected to have a working "delete" and
 *  therefore must always be allocated on the heap.
 *
 *  Some best practices (see also, @ref SharedObject):
 *
 *  @li When returning a shared pointer from a function, return a new @ref SharedPointer rather than a reference.
 *
 *  @li When a shared pointer is used as a function argument, the function can take a const reference argument to avoid
 *  incrementing the reference count in the object. This is safe since the caller will hold a reference to the object for the
 *  duration of the call.
 *
 *  @li Avoid creating circular data structures since the cycle will be self-referencing and thus the objects are not freed
 *  even after the last external reference to the cycle is removed. Breaking the cycle is the only way to cause the objects to
 *  be freeable. An example of a cycle is a tree data structure where a parent has pointers to the children and the children in
 *  turn point back to their parent--each parent-child pair is a cycle.
 *
 *  Use @ref SharedPointer if you need utmost speed, and are able to modify the definition of the pointee class to inherit from
 *  @ref SharedObject, and are willing to always allocate all such objects on the heap not the stack, and don't need weak or
 *  unique pointers to such objects.  Otherwise default to using @c std::shared_ptr et. al. (or @c boost::shared_ptr for C++03
 *  and earlier).
 *
 *  Thread safety: Similar to raw pointers. Different threads can access different pointers to the same object, but operations
 *  on the pointer itself (such as assignment, comparison with null, and dereferencing in the presence of other writers needs
 *  to be synchronized by the callers.
