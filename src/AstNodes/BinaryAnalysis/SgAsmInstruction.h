/** Base class for machine instructions.
 *
 *  @li Each instruction is represented by one or more instances of SgAsmInstruction.
 *
 *  @li An instruction obtained from a full AST will have a parent pointer. The instruction's first ancestor of type @ref
 *  SgAsmBlock is the basic block in which the instruction appears, and its first ancestor of type @ref SgAsmFunction is
 *  the function in which the instruction appears. There may be intervening AST nodes having other types.
 *
 *  @li An instruction obtained from a @ref Rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2::Partitioner "Partitioner" will not have a
 *  parent pointer. You can find ownership information using the Partitioner API.
 *
 *  @li An instruction's bytes will always be contiguous in the virtual address space from which the instruction was
 *  decoded, but might not be contiguous in the file (if any) where the instruction was stored. In fact, there's no
 *  guarantee that the instruction even exists entirely within one file.
 *
 *  @li Two distinct instructions (with different encodings) can start at the same virtual address if the specimen is
 *  self-modifying. Most ROSE analysis assumes that specimens are not self-modifying and uses the instruction's starting
 *  virtual address to uniquely identify the instruction.
 *
 *  @li Two distinct instructions (with different encodings) can occupy overlapping bytes in the virtual address space, and
 *  are guaranteed to have different starting addresses unless the specimen is self-modifying. */
