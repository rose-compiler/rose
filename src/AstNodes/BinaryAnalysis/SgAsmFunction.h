/** Represents a synthesized function.
 *
 *  A function is a collection of blocks holding instructions (basic blocks) or static data.  Instructions might have
 *  references to addresses or data which are described by symbols (not to be confused with the binary's symbol table) in
 *  the function's symbol table (@ref symbolTable property).  Functions do not explicitly exist in a binary, but are
 *  synthesized by ROSE as part of the disassembly and partitioning steps. The individual instructions and/or individual
 *  static data areas need not cover a contiguous region of the address space.  Some synthesized functions will likely not
 *  be a "function" or "produceure" in the strict sense of those words due to such factors as compiler optimizations,
 *  hand-coded routines, exception handling, non-local branching, shortcomings of ROSE's partitioning solvers, etc. In any
 *  case, each function will have one primary entry address.  Although the AST requires that every function have its own
 *  basic block children, which have their own instructions (definition of "tree" data structures), logically two functions
 *  might share basic blocks, although this is uncommon.
 *
 *  Warning: Although currently basic blocks are direct children of function nodes in the AST, this may change in a future
 *  version of ROSE as new node types are introduced to describe scopes and control structures. */
