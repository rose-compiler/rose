The script stl-eval.sh is a bash script that generates programs for each STL header and performs then tests on these programs.

The form of the generated programs is:

#include <HEADER>

int main() { 
  return 0;
}

The HEADER is replaced with each STL header file. E.g. vector, queue,
etc. The file is the pre-processed with cpp. The pre-processed file is
the used for testing. With this test we check whether ROSE can operate
on complete translation units. Note that the pre-processed files can
be very large, between 100 to 40.000 LOC (although the original file
has only a few lines), because the translation unit includes all
header files.

The test script is driven by four lists which contain names of C++STL
header files. These lists are specified at the very beginning of the
script:

STL_CPP98_HEADERS_PASSING="..."
STL_CPP98_HEADERS_FAILING="..."
STL_CPP11_HEADERS_PASSING="..."
STL_CPP11_HEADERS_FAILING="..."

For C++98 and C++11 there are two lists each, one containing the
passing, and one the failing tests. The passing tests are used for
regression testing. Whenever ROSE is improved header names can be
moved from *_FAILING to *_PASSING. Note that the tests are separate
for C++98 and C++11 because the portion of the header files that is
selected for compilation by pre-processor directives in the STL header
files is substantial. When compiled in C++11 mode the code from header
files can be twice as long as in C++98 mode (e.g. instead of 20K you
get 40K LOC after pre-processing).

The language modes are tested with the language option -std=c++98 and
-std=c++11. The test is only applied for newer versions of compilers
that support c++11 (for example starting with gcc 4.8).

If any of the passing tests fail, the script will stop and report an
exit code of 1. In this case the make file will also terminate and
"make check" fails. In case of an error all generated test files
remain in the directory for further investigation of the error. 

The script performs three tests, each of them listed in a separate
column. The result of the test is either PASS or FAIL. An example for
a passing test is:

TESTING: algorithm        :   6964 LOC : PASS PASS PASS : 100.00% 

The three columns show results for three different kinds of tests:

Column 1: the pre-processed file is compiled with the selected
back-end compiler (e.g. g++). This is to ensure that the pre-processed
file can indeed be processed with the provided command line flags. In
future this may be replaced by using ROSE's pre-processor mode.

Column 2: the pre-processed file is compiled with the ROSE
tesTranslator. This test passes if ROSE can read and generate the
file.

Column 3: Takes is input the ROSE generated file and compiles it with
the back end compile (e.g. g++).

If an error occurs, the test is indicated as FAIL and the error line
with the error is reported. An example for a failing test is:

TESTING: bitset           :   7168 LOC : PASS PASS FAIL :  76.70% (LINE:5498) [expected fail]

The reported percentage is simply the error line relative to the total
number of lines (meaning how many lines of the total lines were
processed successfully). All expected failures are marked with
"[expected fail]". Those do not tests do not make the entire check
fail, they are only reported. If one of the expected FAIL tests passes
it should be moved from the list of FAILING tests to the list of
PASSING tests (see above four lists).

If an error occurs the stl-eval.sh stops at the end of each of the two
passing lists of STL headers to be tested. Hence, in case of an error
it stops either after the passing C++98 header tests or the passing
C++11 header tests. It will not stop if one of the expected failing
tests fails.

If the script stops because of an error, all generated files remain in
the directory for further investigation. The generated files are

Input to the three tests corresponding to the three reported columns are:

Column 1: test_$(HEADER).pp.C
Column 2: test_$(HEADER).pp.C
Column 3: rose_test_$(HEADER).pp.C

Hence, if an error is reported in column 3 the line number corresponds
to the file rose_test_$(HEADER).pp.C, where HEADER is one of the STL
header file names (e.g. bitset).

If no error occurs, all generated files are removed and no files
remain in the directory.

Restrictions: the tests are currently restricted to g++4.8 (or newer)
using the EDG front end. The tests will be extended to other compilers
and clang in future. The compilers and the front end are restricted in
Makefile.am.
