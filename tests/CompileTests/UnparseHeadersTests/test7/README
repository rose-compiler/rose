In this test, a single source file includes two header files in
different scopes. One of the header files declares a class. The other
one is in a different folder and contains several nested scopes, each
including one or more other header files from the same folder (4 in
total), also, it declares a variable in the most outer scope. Only the
two header files that are included in the source file should be
unparsed because there are no changes to other included header
files. The unparsed header files should find correctly their included
not unparsed header files.
