# DQ (3/8/2017): Restrict testing to versions of GNU compiler for now for specific versions of EDG.
# Matzke (4/21/2017): None of these tests do anything with EDG, so this complicated logic shouldn't be necessary here. Reverting.
# These unit test directories should be listed so lower software layers are tested before higher layers.
