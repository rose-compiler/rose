This test checks that ROSE can correctly detect and unparse
preprocessor directives (or comments) that appear in a header file,
which is included in more than one place. The bug that this test
exposes consists in ROSE attaching preprocessor directives or comments
only to a single occurrence of the content of the header file included
in multiple places. In this test, the bug would cause ROSE to attach
the #include preprocessor directive to the last occurrence, but the
first occurrence, which does not get the required preprocessor
directive, is unparsed, thus causing this test to fail, unless ROSE
attaches preprocessor directives to all occurrences.
