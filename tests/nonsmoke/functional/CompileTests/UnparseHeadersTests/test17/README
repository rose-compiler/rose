In this test, a single source file includes two header files in
different scopes. One of the header files declares a class, the other
one - contains several nested scopes, each including one or more other
header files (4 in total), and declares a variable in the most outer
scope. All 6 header files are unparsed because at least one variable
is renamed in each of them.
