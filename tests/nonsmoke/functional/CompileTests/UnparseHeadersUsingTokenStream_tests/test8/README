In this test, a single source file includes two header files, each
declaring a different class. Also, these header files include two
different other header files with the same name (and each of the inner
header files declares a distinct variable). To avoid path collisions
among the unparsed and not unparsed header files (i.e. to avoid
finding the wrong file with the same name), additionally to the header
files affected by the rename variable transformation, ROSE unparses
one not affected file.
