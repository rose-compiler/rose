# Filename:  pdiff
#
# Usage:
#            pdiff filename1 filename2 [epsilon in parts per million]
# where
#            epsilon  =  maximum allowable fractional difference
#                        between numbers, default being 1x10-6.
#
# This script does an intelligent compare of two ascii files containing
# text and numeric output.  It treats multiple spaces as one space.
#
# If two numbers are unequal, a delta is calculated equal to the absolute
# value of their difference divided by one of them which is non-zero.  If
# delta is less than epsilon, the two numbers are close enough and their
# difference will be ignored.
#
#
# If parts-per-million was specified, use it; otherwise default to 1.
#
