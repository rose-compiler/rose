/*
 * By Chunhua "Leo" Liao, 9/3/2014
 *
 * A tool to move declarations into innermost scopes when applicable.
 *  On the request from Jeff Keasler, we provide this transformation:
 *  For a declaration, find the innermost scope we can move it into, without breaking the code's original semantics
 *  For a single use place, move to the innermost scope.
 *  For the case of multiple uses, we may need to duplicate the declarations and move to two scopes if there is no variable reuse in between, 
 *    otherwise, we move the declaration into the innermost common scope of the multiple uses. 
 * ********************************************************************************************** 
 *  User instructions: 
 *
 * The translator accepts the following options: 
 *
 * -rose:merge_decl_assign  will merge the moved declaration with an immediately followed assignment. 
 *
 * -rose:aggressive  : turn on the aggressive mode, which will move declarations with initializers, and across loop boundaries.   
 *  A warning message will be sent out if the move crosses a loop boundary.  Without this option, the tool only moves a declaration 
 *  without an initializer to be safe.
 *
 *
 * -rose:debug, which is turned on by default in the testing.  
 *             Some dot graph files will be generated for scope trees of variables for debugging purpose.
 *
 * -rose:keep_going  will ignore assertions as much as possible (currently on skip the assertion on complex for loop initialization statement list).
 *   Without this option, the tool will stop on assertion failures. 
 *  
 * -rose:identity  will turn off any transformations and act like an identity translator. Useful for debugging purposes. 
 *
 * -rose:trans-tracking   will turn on the transformation tracking mode, showing the source statements of a move/merged declaration 
 *
 * ********************************************************************************************** 
 *  Internals: (For people who are interested in how this tool works internally) 
 *
 *  Data structure: we maintain a scope tree, in which each node is 
 *     a scope 1) defining or 2) use the variable, or 3) is live in between .
 *  Several implementation choices for storing the tree
 *  1) The scope tree reuses the AST. AST attribute is used to store extra information  
 *  2) A dedicated scope tree independent from AST. 
 *  3) Storing individual scope chains (paths) in the tree
 *     hard to maintain consistency if we trim paths, hard to debug.
 *
 *  For efficiency, we save only a single scope node  if there are multiple uses in the same scope. 
 *  Also for two use scopes with enclosing relationship, we only store the outer scope in the scope tree and trim the rest. 
 *
 *  Algorithm V1 :
 *    Save the scope of the declaration int DS (declaration statement)
 *
 *    Step 1: create a scope tree first, with trimming 
 *    Pre-order traversal to find all variable references to the declaration
 *    For each reference place
 *    {
 *       back track all its scopes until we reach DS
 *       if DS == US, nothing can be done to move the declaration, stop. 
 *       all scopes tracked are formed into a scope chain (a vector: US .. DS).
 *
 *       create a scope node of use type, called US.
 *       For all scopes in between, create nodes named intermediate scope or IS. 
 *       Add Ds-IS1-IS2..-US (reverse order of the scope chain) into the scope tree, consider consolidating overlapped scope chains;
 *          1) if an intermediate scope is equal to a use scope of another scope chain; stop add the rest of this chain. 
 *          2) if we are adding a use scope into the scope tree, but the same scope is already added by a intermediate scope from anther chain
 *             we mark the  existing scope node as a use scope, and remove its children from the scope tree.
 *    }
 *
 *    Step 2: find the scopes to move the declaration into
 *    find the innermost scope containing all paths to leaves: inner_scope: single parent, multiple children
 *    count the number of children of inner_scope: 
 *      if this is only one leaf: move the declaration to the innermost scope
 *      if there are two scopes: 
 *          not liveout for the variable in question?  Duplicate the declaration and move to each scope chain. 
 *          if yes liveout in between two scopes.  No duplication, move the declaration to inner_scope
 *
 *  Iterative moving process: 
 *
 *   For duplicated declarations inserted into inner scopes, we have to consider if they can be moved further.
 *     So we use a worklist to store all variable declarations to be considered.
 *     The worklist is initialized with original declarations in the code.
 *     New declarations are added into the worklist during the duplication/insertion process.
 *     The entire process terminate when the worklist becomes empty.      
 *
 * Algorithm V2: further optimization on top of v1
 *    for analysis-move, we find all bottom scopes at once and only do move once after that
 *    the scope trees are the new worklist now.
 *    This eliminates the intermediate moving of declarations and is much more efficient. 
 *    Details for how to do the iterative analysis can be found at comments for findFinalTargetScopes ()
 *
 *  //TODO optimize efficiency for multiple declarations
 * //TODO move to a separated source file or even namespace

/*
We cannot simply merge a declaration at a location A with an assignment at a location B.
This is essentially moving one statement across some code region so liveness or side effect analysis info. is needed for safety.
If the assignment's right hand operand uses any variable declared or written somewhere between A and B, 
we cannot move it up and merge it with the declaration.

int i=0
int tmp =10;
i = myarray[tmp]; // this cannot be moved up

Consider only right hand is not enough, the variable declared on left side must be in the set by default.

     int j;
   {
// initially built into scope tree, later trimmed. 
          j = 0;
        }
//this should trigger trimming the previous path 
      j = 2; // this cannot be moved up ??


The best solution is liveness analysis (or side effect analysis).
An approximation being used now is to not move when there is any references to variables used by the assignment (either lhs or rhs).

Pre-order iteration of decls is needed to check if it is mergeable: move assign up to merge with the declaration.
Example: if use reverse order: double abc will be checked first,  the last assignment cannot be moved up since rhs uses aa, which is defined in between.

Using pre-order : double aa is considered first, aa=a[i] is moved up.   Then double abc; abc= aa* aa; can be merged also.
        double aa;
        double abc; //
        aa = a[i];   
        abc = aa * aa;  //

Differentiate two situations when handling special scopes
1:  when obtaining a scope for a variable in the condition expression. The scope should be adjusted since we cannot insert things to the conditions (??)
2:  when deciding on if we can insert a decl to the special scopes:  This has two further situations: 
   2.1  the special scope is a final bottom scope . We have backtrack to its parent scope  
   2.2  the special scope is an intermediate scope.  we can still put it into the worklist since the iterative algorithm v 2

To simplify the problem, we consider them all in one pace: situation 2. hasUnsupportedScope() helps decide how to put scopes to the worklist.
We don't do anything special for situation 1.

TODO: Alternatively, we screen out bad scopes as early and possible in this function.
     Later algorithm2 will not be bothered. 

 *We don't try to merge a variable decl into the conditional of a while statement
 * The reason is that often the declaration has an initializer , which must be preserved.
 * The conditional contain the use of the declared variable, which usually cannot be merged with the declaration.
 * e.g.  int yy = 10; while (yy< 100) { yy ++; ... }
 * Another tricky thing is even though yy shows up in both condition and while-body, 
 * the scope tree will only show while-stmt as the single scope node since the body scope is shadowed. 
 * Note: the scope of the condition is considered to be the while-stmt.
 * TODO in a rare case like   int yy = 10; while (yy) { } we can merge the declaration and condition together.

The issue is that n3 can be unsupported scope (scope into which we cannot insert a decl, like a while-stmt scope).
n3 is not bottom. On the surface, we can put n3 into scope_trees worklist for further consideration.
n2 is put to the final_target_scopes as a final scope.

But if n3 has no legitimate children or grand children nodes to accept the moved down declarations, 
we have to back track and invalid n2 also. 

Option 1: simplest.  create a new basic block scope before the unsupported scope. looks a bit bad. but simple to implement.
//TODO : ask users for their opinions

Option 2: whenever a search for a scope tree at a root does not find a single eligible final target scope, 
we have to backtrack trough the scope tree, find an upper eligible final target scope.
In the meantime, we have to invalidate the root's sibling nodes (and all children?) in the final target scope set, 
  and possibly invalidate some nodes (sibling and all children?) in the scope tree worklist. 

   invalidate and mark the affected nodes as considered also. 

The scope tree worklist is a queue?, depth first traverse is used

The invalidation can happen in a postprocessing function: search 

Option 3: run the analysis twice: the first time mark all possible final scopes, then mark each scope nodes to indicate if it has a potential
  child target node. 
 The 2nd time uses the previous results to decide if we can put a unsupported scope node into the worklist
This is not elegant, but easy to understand and implement.

The 2nd run is only necessary when there is a unsupported, non-bottom scope node being pushed to the worklist!!

/*
Find all bottom scopes to move into: no side effect on AST at all

1. Initialization: 
  source_scope_trees: the top scope tree of the single decl in question

2. For each tree of  source_scope_trees: find candidate scopes, save into target_scopes
  collect candidate scopes 
      n0
      | 
      n1
     / \
    n2  n3
 
We differentiate two kinds of candidate scopes: 

 final_target_scopes: know for certain this is the final one. No need for further consideration. 
  * It can be a real bottom scope , or 
  * an intermediate scope which is reached by backtracking from a unsupported bottom scope. No use to go deeper.

 scopetree worklist_scopes: a scope which is a child of a first branch node. and it is not the bottom.  

   a. Single node scope tree, if diff from orig_scope, add to target_scopes.  
        TODO: && !isUnSupportedScope ()   It is already a bottom scope (s_use type) 
   b. Multiple nodes tree: find the first branching node
                         && !isUnSupportedScope()  Does this matter? if some middle scope is not supported. No big deal really.  
      i. Single path tree: First branch node is a bottom: push to target_scopes as a candidate
                      Is supportedScope important?  Yes. unsupported will not accept decl to be inserted. 
                      TODO: how to handle this cleanly?  backtrack to a scope node which is supported, mark it as final? No redundant consideration.

      ii. Multiple path tree:  First branch node has multiple children
          1. No move down if has liveIn, push first-branch scope into target_scope, if it is diff from orig_scope
          2. No move down if any of the children is not supported (while, if, switch, etc.) && is a final (s_use type) target scope 
             Reason: a final, unsupported scope cannot accept the declaration!!
                     an intermediate , unsupported scope can serve as a new root for further move consideration
          For both no move down case: it is the same handling for the single path case b-i (reuse the code)           

          3. Move to multiple scopes: for each child’s first branch 
             if the child scope is final , add to final_target_scope
             if not final, add to worklist_scopes.  

3. Target_scopes to source_scope_trees transition, caused by non-bottom scopes
   This is to handle uneven bottom scope issues, as demonstrated below:
      n0
      | 
      n1
     / \
    n2  n3
       / \
      n4  n5 
First branching node is n1.   No liveIn between n2 and n3. So candidate collection step will collect n2 and n3.
For all candidate scopes, if they have further children, they should be treated as a new root for brand new consideration.
One example is n3 is If-stmt which is a scope. 
We need to add n3 as a new scope tree root for further consideration. 
n2 is kept/saved as one of the final target scopes

4. if (!Check stop condition):   repeat 2 and 3, essentially do (2, 3) while ()
   a. scope tree: root scopes are processed (finished) a scopelist, source_scopes becomes empty
   b. // Implicitly ensured by 3 all target_scopes are bottom, no non-bottom scopes like if-stmt anymore

Finally delete the scope tree in any cases.  IF the same AS orig_scope, skip moving.  delete still.
