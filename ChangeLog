2008-1-x  Dan Quinlan 0.9.1a

	* Removed the ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/visualization
	  directory since ti si old code superseded by zgrviewer.
	  Note that zgrviewer is available on the web (SourceForge).
	
	* Removed the ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics
	  directory since it is old code that is not used and it
	  is superceeded by a new design.

	* Remove ROSE/prjects/BinaryContextLookup directory since
	  it has xml dependences that may not be available for users.
	  This might mean that we don't need the xml configure option 
	  as well.

	* Added support for Yices SMT Solver (see configure options).
	  Run "configure --help" to see configure options.

	* Updated to new Open Fortran Parser (1/18/2008).

	* Added more support for Fortran "entry statement".

	* Reviewed previous bugs in Fortran support to see which ones were
	  fixed by the new version of OFP and moved those fixed testcode
	  to the list required to pass.

	* Fixed Yices support to use AST attributes for Yices expressions.

	* -lfl should no longer be required on the link line. The yywrap
	  requirement that caused this should not be gone.

	* Added include directories to the path to avoid paths to header
	  files being wrong after the install (allowing make install to 
	  work for the binary analysis option.



2008-1-8  Dan Quinlan 0.9.0b

	* Added required files to allow distribution to be compiled with 
	  common configure options: Fortran, HPCToolKit, Binary Analysis.

	* Fixed a number of minor details that permit the distribution
	  built with any minimal set of configure options to be built
	  with all possible options.  This required added EXTRA_DIST
	  entries as required to be all required files in place into
	  the distribution independent of the configure options used
	  to build the distribution.  A new test script:
	       ROSE/scripts/roseTestDistribution
	  can be used to test this.

	* Added Liao's latest work on the Fortran outliner and OpenMP
	  work.

	* Added latest patches specific to binary analysis.


2008-1-7  Dan Quinlan 0.9.0a

	* Added Fortran 2003 support (using LANL Open Fortran Parser).
	  There are too many Fortran specific details to list.  Furture
	  work will add more details specific to Fortran progress to the
	  ChangLog.

	* Added initial support for binary analysis, there are too many
	  details specific to this as well. So future work will address
	  more specifics about what additional progress is made here.

	* Name qualification mechnaism (for code generation) is now
	  significantly faster and avoids a quadratic complexity. It is
	  now linear, but it is still too expensive, and will be worked on
	  further in the future (timings are now availabel for this;
	  using -rose:verbose 2).

	* Numerous template details specific to compatability with later
	  versions of g++ (versions 4.0 through 4.2) have been fixed.

	* Fixed use of offsetOf macro for GNU version 3.4 and greater.

	* Added back most of the symbol table handling functions
	  previously removed (in 0.8.8a). test2007_24.C demonstrates
	  that symbols with the same name are allows in a scope and
	  that we need these type specific functions to look for 
	  the correct symbols (require by AST merge mechanism).

	* Added substantial number of functiosn to SgSymbolTable
	  and SgScopeStatement to handle the symbole tables in ROSE.
	  
	* Fixed mumber functions to be const in unparser.

	* Modified SgArrayType to delete it index expression (changed to
	  DEF_DELETE in ROSETTA specification).  Doen to support AST
	  merge.

	* Added member functions in all relavant IR nodes to lookup
	  the associated SgSymbol.

	* Added remove function that takes a specific SgSymbol, since
	  removing all SgSymbols or derived classes from SgSymbol
	  that match the name is dangerous since there can be multiple
	  entries under a given name (e.g. typedef struct X{} X;")
	  or symbols of the exact same type can be repeated when 
	  declared without names (e.g. "struct {}; struct {};").
	  The new functions provide the required precission to 
	  remove indificual symbols who's internal declarations 
	  (using "get_basis_()" member function) match a specific
	  declaration.

	* Fixed const handling for unparseToString() member function.
	  Lots of associated const details were also addressed to make the
	  IR easier to use.

	* SgTemplateSymbol was previously not placed correct in the EDG
	  AST, we now use the template referenced through the 
	  canonical_template (which is the location of the first template).

	* Loading and unloading of symbols for template instantiations
	  is now done for all name chages in the template name resetting
	  (in post-processing).

	* Symbol table senmantics now modified to disallow addition of
	  symbol with name not matching the associated symbols declaration
	  (the name generated from the declaration).

	* Multiple symbols using the same associated declaration are not
	  allowed in the same symbol table (no checking for symbols
	  entered in to more than one symbol table, see below).  
	  
	* Scope of symbol table must match that of the scope of the 
	  associated declaration (when inserted into the symbol table, 
	  not after being shared).

	* SgClassDefinition objects that are never defined are generated
	  internally in SageIII and not correctly marked as compiler
	  generated.

	* Redundant SgBasicBlock is eliminated for case of "if" statement
	  without an explicit "else" case.
	  
	* Redundant declarations of functions in separate name spaces wuth
	  the same name (e.g. "std") are now properly handled within AST
	  merge.

	* Skipped building SgVariableSymbol for "..." when used in catch
	  statement.

	* Fixed use of many IR nodes in ROSE by enforcing and correcting
	  locations where an IR node is not in the child listof its
	  parent. This was a test that was previously suggested by
	  Jeremiah, and implemented by Ghassan, but for which the AST
	  previously reported many violations.  Many of these are fixed
	  and the exceptions noted in theAST consistancy tests that test
	  this aspect of the AST.

	* Modifed type SgClassDeclaration to use the defined enum type
	  SgClassDeclaration::class_types instead of an "int" for the
	  p_class_type data member (which appears in the constructor
	  parameter list).
	

	* Added SgStatement data member pointer to SgLabelStatement
	  to better match the C and C++ grammar. The use of this is
	  not implemented.

	* Added integer numeric label to SgStatement to support Fortran
	  numeric labels.

	* SgProcedureHeaderStatement should be removed in favor of a
	  function, which if it is a proedure use return void type.
	  This subject is currently under review, work by Gina would have
	  to be updated.

	* Added SgFortranNonblockedDo, derived from SgFortranDo.
	  Adds SgStatement pointer to labeled terminating action-statement
	  (which can be shared, so is not traversed, at least for now).

	* Modified SgFortranDo to ise SgExpression* for the initializer,
	  test condiditon, and increment; to better conform to the
	  standard.

	* Modified std::string parameters to be pass by reference instead
	  of pass by value for the case of Sg_File_Info constructor,
	  PreprocessingInfo constructor, and
	  ROSEAttributesList::addElement() member function.

	* Fixed source position of function declaration prototypes 
	  (secondary declarations are not alwasy getting the correct
	  source position information; e.g. forward class declarations).

	* Fixed source position information computed for calls to
	  conversion operators when specified as references to types
	  (e.g. "class A { operator int&(); };" when called using
	  "A x; (int)x;" (see test2007_44.C)).

	* Fixed definitions of size_t which conflicted presiously with
	  where it was defined in (commented out our definitions):
	  rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h.in

	* Fixed case of enum types used in using declarations 
	  (see test2007_50.C).

	* Fixed case of function call from typedef of function pointer.
	  (see test2007_45.C).

	* Fixed use of old style automake macros and enforced that
	  automake 1.9.6 or newer is used and autoconf 2.5.9 or newer is
	  used.

	* Fixed use of PACKAGE and VERSION macros in makefiles and 
	  changed to PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION acording the new
	  style automake.

	* Added optional argument to take variant:
	  SgSymbolTable::print( std::string label, VariantT nodeType )
	  This allows to output only specific types of symbols when used
	  and is helpful for debugging symbol table details.

	* Moved SgClassSymbols associated with SgTemplateInstantiationDecl
	  to the scope of the SgTemplateInstantiationDecl (we previously
	  placed in the current scope (curr_sg_scope and this was most
	  often SgGlobal).  This implementation is more uniform with the
	  handling of other symbols.

	* Fixed const class members initialized in class generate a
	  SgVariableSymbol and add it to the class definition's symbol
	  table. See test2005_32.C.  This was required for the name
	  qualification to work properly.
	
        * Added initial support for Fortran, using Open Fortran 2003 Parser
	  from Los Alamos.

	* Reorganized unparser to provide support for multiple languages.

	* Added unparser support for Fortran language.
	
	* Refactored SgType::stripTypedefsAndModifiers() to use SgType::stripType().

	* Improved on copy mechanism to make copies avoid references to
	  the original AST subtree being copied.

	* SgLabelStatement now has an explicit data member to store the
	  scope.  The hasExplicitScope() member function has been updated
	  appropriately.

	* Friend template declaration is not marked as friend. 

	* The Cxx_GrammarTerminalNames array which maps enum values to
	  strings is now implemented in terms of the new V_SgNode names
	  instead of the older Sage III tag names (which have been
	  depricated for a long time).

	* Added fix suggested by Valentin David to makelinks script.

	
	
2007-06-04  Dan Quinlan  0.8.10e
	* Fixed use of staticly dimensioned C style string to
	  hold command line when using -rose:astMerge option.
	  This option will be more useful in the next release.

	* Fixed reference to bddbddb file output/RelationVisitor.cc
	  (got the fix from Rich Vuduc).  This was an isue with 
	  using automake 1.9.2 and was not an isue for 1.9.6.
	  However there are other details of the ROSE configuration
	  which makes this release work better with 1.9.2.  Use of
	  automake 1.9.6 will likely be required for future releases
	  of ROSE (next release).

	* Fixed handling of -jn option for compilation of
	  tutorial/liaOutliner directory.

	* Split lists of passing/failing C++ tests into separate reusable
	Makefile stubs, so that they can be reused in other module

	metrics in the AST when a particular metric could map to multiple
	SgStatement nodes. Also removed a few out-dated C++ constructs.

2007-02-16 Richard Vuduc 0.8.10b

	* Fixed a bug in which standard library paths were hard-coded into
	the EDG_SAGE_Connection convenience library (libedgSage.la), since
	these paths would appear in the ROSE EDG-binary distributions. The
	fix distributes the libtool object file (".lo" file) instead of
	the libtool library (".la").
	(src/frontend/EDG_SAGE_Connection/Makefile.am, scripts/libtoolcp,
	src/Makefile.am)

	* Replaced the use of ImageMagick's "convert" with "ps2pdf" when
	generating the PDF version of the ROSE directory map in the
	documentation. The "convert" can quickly run out of memory and
	fail to complete when the directory structure becomes large.
	(docs/Rose/Makefile.am)

	* Replaced a hard-coded reference to "g++" with
	"$(CXX)".

2007-01-15 Dan Quinlan 0.8.10a
	* Added support to fix "-D DEFINE_ERROR_WITH_SPACE"
	  as opposed to "-DDEFINE_OK_WITHOUT_SPACE".  This
	  caused many Plum Hall tests to fail. Orphaned option.

	* Added support for "signed char" within EDG/Sage translation.

	* Added libtool support (work by Peter Collingbourne)

	* Added portability to Cygwin (by Peter Collingbourne).
	
	* Added portability to OSX (by Peter).  Still have OSX asm
	  commands using non-X86 registers to fix.

	* Comma operator get_type() now implemented, but used to use
	  SgBinaryOp::get_type() which returns the type of the lhs.
	  But the comma operator should return the type of the rhs, so 
	  a SgCommaOp::get_type() function was implemented to enfoce this.

	* SgPntrArrRefExp::get_type() fixed to return SgTypeChar
	  (previously it triggered the default case which is an error).

	* Fixed null pointer to firstnondefining declaration for
	  SgClassDeclaration in case of vacuous destructor
	    (test2004_35.C).

	* Recieved Rama's and Peter's fix for
	  ROSE/projects/DocumentationGenerator/doxygenComment.lex file.
	  This now works across flex versions: FLEX-2.5.31  FLEX-2.5.33
	  FLEX-2.5.4a.  If we want to be able to test flex compatability
	  we should have FLEX-2.5.31  FLEX-2.5.33 installed locally. We
	  most commonly use FLEX-2.5.4a for development work within ROSE.
	  Note that version number of flex are misleading: 
	     FLEX-2.5.4a released June 27, 1997
	     FLEX-2.5.31 released March 3, 2003
	     FLEX-2.5.33 released February 21, 2006
	  What were they thinking?!

	* Fixed name qualification use in C. Bug report from IBM
	  demonstrated that name qualification was leaking into the C code
	  generation.
	
	* Completely reimplemented name qualification support within the
	  code generation. A number of test codes demonstrated that the
	  existing system had some fundamental problems and the support in
	  EDG for name qualification did appear to be complete.

	* Fixed non-defining function declarations to only add symbols to
	  the local scope if the scope suports definingFunctionDeclarations
	  (supportsDefiningFunctionDeclaration() == true).

	* Added valid endOfConstruct file info to SgExpression IR nodes.
	  this was previously NULL for nearly all expression IR nodes.

	* Fixed position information for the startOfConstruct file info
	  (source position information) for LOTS of expressions. Fixed
	  endOfConstruct inforamtion for statements and expressions. The
	  handling of source position information in the EDG/Sage III
	  translation was completely rewritten to provide a more precise
	  and modular implementation.

	* Added Jeremiah's suggestion (and patch) to optionally allow
	  most "unions" in EDG to be "structs" so that we can better
	  debug the EDG/Sage III translation. This is now a configure
	  option (see configure --help).

	* Fixed EDG to allow std::size_t instead of size_t type as new
	  operator's parameter. The new operator for GNU 3.4.x is 
	  defined this way and EDG trapped it out as an error in its 
	  internal testing.  EDG's decls.C was modified and comments added.

	* Fixed semantics of where set_parent() is called. It used to be
	  called within the access function (several years ago), this was
	  fixed to permit these access function to be side-effect free
	  (except where the set_<name> function updated the p_<name>
	  variable).  However, this removed the semantics from numerous
	  function which had previously called the access functions.
	  The reest some of this semantic behavior (for example
	  constructors shoudl likely set the parameters of their input
	  arguments) mane calls to set_parent() have been explicitly
	  added.  They have been in the SgExpression IR nodes (but not
	  uniformally), this is not uniform, plus it is extended to 
	  be done in the lowest level AST editing functions (e.g.
	  member functionsof the IR nodes; such as replace_expression(),
	  etc.).  This is done now for SgStatements and SgExpressions.
	  this general fix to the semantics makes it easier to build code
	  within transformations.  The function to test and reset the 
	  parents within the post-processing of the AST will check these
	  setting so make sure they are consistant with the AST
	  traversal's definition of the AST (very important to us!).

	* Added interface to SgLocatedNode to mark IR nodes as compiler
	  generated, frontend specific, output in code generation,
	  source position unavailable in frontend.  These are 
	  typically set in the Sg_File_Info, but now we have two for
	  SgStatement, and three for SgExpression, this move helps make
	  the marking of IR nodes uniform (this is also tested now as
	  well).

	* Disallowed __SIZE_TYPE__ and __PTRDIFF_TYPE__ to be defined by EDG
	  and let them be set by the backend compiler (within the ROSE
	  configuration step). These are 32-bit and 64-bit specific.

	* Added traversal to adjust/reset/fixup the Sg_File_Info objects 
	  of parent nodes to be consistant with the extrema of source
	  position information of their children. This permits more
	  accurate line and column number information to be generated more
	  consitantly.  This was later modified to restrict the resetting
	  of source position by children to SgBasicBlock IR nodes
	  (specifically the source position of an IR node cannot be
	  propogated beyond its scope; this avoid errors propogating to
	  far from there original source).

	* Fought with the 100 character Posix limitation for TAR (now 
	  enforced by GNU tar 1.14, used in new versions of Linux).
	     1) Removed the project/containerParallelization project that
	        was outdated and had several problem files.
	     2) Renamed files in ROSE/ROSE_ResearchPapers
	     3) Removed exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/astProcessingExamples
	        (these are old examples not referenced from anywhere and 
	        redundant with some of the tutorial examples (there the
	        exaxt same examples are presented).
	     4) Removed some of the filenames from:
	        ROSE/src/3rdPartyLibraries/PDFlib-Lite-6.0.2rv/distfiles.txt
	        (only those that were a problem).

	* All documentation moved to PDF (using pdflatex). All the figures
	  generated and maintained interally are not saved as pdf files as
	  well. All references to Postscript documentation has been
	  removed and all use of latex2html has been eliminated (it
	  never worked well enough). This is done in preparation for
	  the release of ROSE documentation on the web.

	* Modified AstInterface.C to use unique names (instead of
	  "_astInterface_Tmp.c" so that parallel testing of the 
	  loop processor could be done safely (failed infrequently).

	* Modified the COPYRIGHT notice to make it more clear that ROSE
	  is distributed under BSD license by LLNL.

	* Fixed numberous bugs related to name qualification as a result
	  of the new implementation.

	* Fixed the OpenMP compiler (built by Liao) using ROSE. Numerous
	  details.  Tests of the OpenMP compiler are now run and only the
	  execution of the tests are effected by the setup of the Omni
	  OpenMP runtime system at configure time.  This assures that
	  Liao's work will be regularly tested.

	* Fixed Makefiles for testing of A++, which caught an error.
	  A++ is now regularly tested within ROSE.  The previous 
	  steps to remove this testing were a mistake.

	* Fixed secondary declaration source position information
	  (obtained from a different location in the EDG AST).

	* Fixed name qualification for function parameters. Used
	  to return the qualified name associated with the function
	  but should have stopped the recursion through scopes at
	  the SgFunctionDefinition.  This was handled by implementing 
	  a special purpose SgFunctionDefinition::get_qualified_name()
	  member function that returns an empty name (same as for the 
	  SgBasicBlock IR node).

	* Fixed where name qualification was being done for "C" code.

	* Fixed where global qualifiers were used in the code generation
	  for SgInitializedName object in SgVariableDeclaration IR nodes.
	  
	* Fixed name qualification for the base type of typedefs
	  (previously omitted under the new rewrite of name
	  qualification).  This bug was masked by the generation of
	  class specifiers where they were not required for C++.

	* Tried to eliminate use of class specifier in typedefs for C++,
	  but the information about where they are required is not set
	  properly in EDG (likely only based on the more complex rules
	  that can cause the class specifier to require rather than if
	  it is expect in the source code.  This will require more help
	  from the parse tree to establish explicit use in the source
	  code.

	* Added file name extension support (work by Dan and Rama).
          ROSE now recognizes a multitude of filename extensions,
          like c, C, cxx, cpp, c++, cp, C. This also includes:
          (1) proper recognition of a file as C language or C++ language
	  file and (2) proper actions and error-messages for what to do on
          case-(in)sensitive systems. In both of the above, "proper" means
	  conformant to GNU gcc and g++, and to an extent to EDG.

	* Removed specification of __STDC_HOSTED__ from generated file:
	  rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h (which containes
	  required macro definitions and function declarations (often for
	  builtin functions) required to match EDG frontend with the
	  backend compiler.  Parts of this file are automatically
	  generated specific to the requirements of the backend compiler
	  used with ROSE (set at configure time for ROSE).

	* Modified configure script to process include directories in
	  the background (simply by using "&"). This greatly improved 
	  the performance of of the configure step on parallel machines 
	  (multi-core or multiprocessor).
	       21.67user 35.41system 0:55.64elapsed 102%CPU (serial)
	       14.25user 20.75system 0:36.82elapsed 95%CPU (parallel)

	* Turned on warnings for compilation of ROSE (new default value).
	  To turn these off specify --with-CXX_WARNINGS="" and 
	  --with-C_WARNINGS="".  For the intel compiler we turn on 
	  additional options -Wp64 (for 64-bit conversion warnings)
	  and -Wcheck (additional warnings).

	* Removed old use of macro switch to use include files with and
	  without the ".h" suffix.  Modern C++ compilers don't have this
	  problem, I think.  This simplifies the code and makes it
	  clearer.

	* Added BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX to handle boost specific suffic codes on
	  all their libraries (e.g. "gcc34" for GNU 3.4.x built library).


	* Refixed the GNU tar problem to detect use of GNU tar 1.14 at 
	  configure time and skip the use of the "-o" option.  This is
	  required for 32 bit machines and required to not be there for 64
	  bit machines if we want to avoid 100 char limits on filenames.
	  This forces use of posix, which contrary to what I previously
	  though has unlimited absolute path lengths.

	* Added configure option to permit optional longer internal tests
	  using "make check".  The default is to do shorter tests.
	  ROSE developers should use the longer tests for development
	  but users are not required to run such long tests (which can
	  be a problem on even very new parallel multi-core processors).

	* Intel compiler does not have an libxml2 library and so we get
	  the error message "IPO link: can not find -lxml2", this is not
	  a problem for the GNU compilers which file the libxml2.so in
	  /usr/libs by default.

	* Added "-restrict" option to backend when using icc or icpc.
	  This is required to process the "restrict" keyword.

	* Current Problems:
	   1) Wave implementation of preprocessor directive handling
	      is not robust (see Cxx_tests/test_CplusplusMacro_Cpp.C).
	      Not significant issue, this is the inital release of this
	      work and it will require at least one more iteration
	      (Andreas is working on this).
	   2) Intel version using libxml2 library fails for 64bit only
	      (Intel error "can't find libxml2 library".  Not much to do 
	      about this but build a special version of xml2 using Intel 
	      compiler and fix the configuration to point to it.
	   3) Intel compiler has different rules for name qualification
	      (which are more strict than GNU so we still have a few
	      errors).  See test2003_09.C for example of over
	      qualification which fails for icpc, but passes for 
	      GNU g++ 3.4.x compiler. This fails for both 32bit and 64bit
	      platforms. This will not be fixed in this release.
	   4) Intel compiler (32bit) fails to compile gnerated code by 
	      OpenMP compiler (for a few cases).

	* Fixed p_linkage to be a std::string instead of char*
	  (required for for gnu g++ 4.1.2 which was sensitive to 
	  the use of this internally, which allowed the AST merge to work
	  with the 53 file smg2000 application).

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********

	
2006-09-07 Dan Quinlan 0.8.9a
	* Remove predifed macros in EDG (macro.c and sys_predef.c, but not
	  in preproc.c and symbol_tbl.c).  Only removed those that don't
	  create symbols (so are not used in internal EDG processing (e.g
	  __LINE__ and __FILE__).

	* Edited the ROSE/config/compiler-defs.m4 to avoid filtering of
	  #define directives found to be in use by the backend compiler
	  (so that we could have then ALL).  They were previously filtered
	  because they caused errors within EDG (because they were
	  predefined and could not be reset).

	* Fixed test2006_94.C: unsigned, long, long long, unsigned long,
	  and unsigned long long literals now use "U", "L", ""LL", "UL",
	  "ULL" respectively within the code generation.  These will be
	  held as strings (same as floating-point literals in a later,
	  next, release (this is now complete in this release)).

	* Fixed fileInfo in case of placement option of new operator
	  to default to that of the new operator when the placement 
	  argument does not have a valid fileInfo (e.g. case of 
	  "new (std::nothrow) myVar").

	* Added GNU StatementExpression extension to ROSE (bug report from
	  Yarden).

	* Added SgAsmOp IR node to handle asm operand list in the
	  SgAsmStmt.

	* Fixed SgAsmStmt to contain an STL list of SgAsmOp IR nodes.
	  (Note that Microsoft permits multiple entries in the asm
	  statement which would force a modification of this design.)

	* Fixed GNU header file (limit) to build macro for min and max
	  values of types so that there is no overflow (for wchar_t) 
	  or conversion to integer loosing the sign (for char). The
	  correct macro is editing into place within the header file
	  translation phace of the configuration.  We don't yet know how
	  specific this might be to specific versions of GNU, but it
	  works at least for gnu version 3.3.2.
#if 0
// This definition causes a warning when used with EDG, but not with gnu 3.3.x.
#define __glibcpp_min(T) \
  (__glibcpp_signed (T) ? (T)1 << __glibcpp_digits (T) : (T)0)

#define __glibcpp_max(T) \
  (__glibcpp_signed (T) ? ((T)1 << __glibcpp_digits (T)) - 1 : ~(T)0)
#else
// DQ (7/24/2006): This is a better definition required since EDG evaluates
// the return expression indepement of the return type (as GNU appears to
// do, and thus causing EDG warnings).

// We have cast to the input type after computing the shift operation.
#define __glibcpp_min(T) \
  (__glibcpp_signed (T) ? (T)(1 << __glibcpp_digits (T)) : (T)0)

// We have made the "1" a long long and done the shift and subtraction before the cast.
#define __glibcpp_max(T) \
    (__glibcpp_signed (T) ? (T)((1LL << __glibcpp_digits (T)) - 1) : ~(T)0)
#endif

	* Tested hexadecimal floating point representation (this is a bit
	  obscure), see test2006_99.C: "float x = 0x1.fp3;".  This works
	  in EDG and ROSE was previously only a value, Rama has added the
	  string based representation required for proper source-to-source
	  handling (and required for work with the Interval Analysis guys).

	* Added string option to SgFloatVal, SgDoubleVal, and
	  SgLongDoubleVal constructors.  Previously one has to 
	  call the set_string() function to set the string value of
	  a floating point literal.

	* Fixed redundant SgBasicBlock which EDG places around "if",
	  "while", "do while", "switch" statements. This is explicitly
	  detected and the outer SgBasicBlock (already generated) is
	  stripped off.

	* Fixed case of "if(0);" which worked for C++ but fails for 
	  C (C_only mode).

	* Removed output:
 	  "SAGE III now calling gen_old_style_parameter_decls()"
	  and removed the call to gen_old_style_parameter_decls()
	  since it is a normalization that is not wanted for the AST.
	  (it should be an error as well, but likely the list that it
	  iterates over is alwas NULL, so it has not be a problem 
	  previously. Reported by Yarden.

	* Replace use of ftime with gettimeofday() in 
	  src/midend/loopProcessing/driver/TransformComputation.C 
          since ftime is now deprecated (even on linux) and replaced by
	  gettimeofday.
	// struct timeb tb;
	// ftime (&tb);
	// cout << msg << ": " << tb.time << " : " << tb.millitm << endl;
	   struct timeval tp;
	   struct timezone* tzp = NULL;
	   int status = gettimeofday (&tp,tzp);
	   assert(status == 0);
	   cout << msg << ": " << tp.tv_sec << " : " << tp.tv_usec << endl;

	* Added mechanism to report when there is too little memory for
	  system command required to run the backend compiler. This
	  happens when compiling test2006_02.C on smaller systems that
	  the students seem to have.

	* Added Rama's EDG fix to store floating point literals as
	  strings.

	* Modified SgConstructorInitializer to explicitly store the type
	  instead of the SgClassDeclaration (p_class_decl was removed).
	  This generalization (suggested by Jeremiah) allows constructors
	  of primative types (e.g. "double* x = new double();").

	* Changed PreprocessingInfo::directiveTypeName() and
	  PreprocessingInfo::relativePositionName() to be static functions
	  (instead of const member functions).

	* Added example of how to access comments and directives to ROSE
	  Tutorial.

	* Added example of how to build list of #define directives to ROSE
	  Tutorial.  Uses synthesized attributes.

	* Added fix from Markus's student specific to code generation from
	  SgExpressionRoot (previously an empty function).

	* Fixed get_type() return value for SgTypeIdOp, C++ standard
	  requires it to return "std::type_info" class.  Test placed into
	  EDG/Sage III translation to make sure that the return type is
	  generated properly.

	* Reported normalizations used with expressions are input to
	  the C++ typeid() operator. Normalization example documented in
	  the SageIII.tex file (Sage III Chapter of ROSE User Manual)
	  in section specific to source-to-source normalizations.

	* Fixed support for --edg:c (and fixed mistaken reference to
	  --edg:cc in User Manual).  This previously only partially
	  works within ROSE.

	* Fixed support for --version and --V from any ROSE translator
	  where a file name is not specified.  Previously only worked
	  when a file name was present on the command line.

	* Added support for optional marking of generated codes using
	  "#define ROSE_GENERATED_CODE" macro (which can then be tested
	  by transformation or other mechanisms).  This permits support
	  of mechanisms (tests) that would avoid translating previously
	  translatoed code.  The use of this feature is optional and it
	  is off by default; and turned on using "-rose:markGeneratedCode"
	  from the commandline of any ROSE build translator.  Information
	  about this option was alos placed into the usage() function
	  (which reports options, called by "--help" option).

	* Added support for intel compiler to ROSE/acmacros/compiler-ar.m4 
	  and ROSE/config/support-rpath.m4.

	* Removed macros from being define (filter requirements) for
	  Intel compiler (exclude list):
	     #define __cplusplus 1
	     #define __DATE__ "Aug  9 2006"
	     #define __TIME__ "19:39:55"
	     #define __EDG__ 1
	     #define __EDG_VERSION__ 304
	     #define _WCHAR_T 1

	* Fixed parsing of output from Intel compiler to generate the list
	  of #define parameters and the header file lists.

	* Fixed -rose:C option to not set turn on C99 mode by accident
	  (use -rose:C99 or -rose:C99_only (these are the same)).

	* Fixed #pragma indent "", which has some some strange quoting
	  rules that are relaxed in GNU but more strict in Intel.

	* Fixed asm command: registers must have lower case names for
	  Intel compiler, but case is unimportant for GNU.

	* Fixed _Complex within C99 to both store the precision of the
	  complex type (float, double, long double) and put it out as
	  required for the code generation (before or after the _Complex
	  keyword; I have selected before).  Gnu is relaxed on this
	  subject and "_Complex x;" is enough, but Intel requires
	  a precision (floating point type name) "float _Complex x;".
	  Note that Intel also permits "_Complex float x;", but the
	  grammar would seem to document "float _Complex x;" as prefered.

	* Added #define __NO_STRING_INLINES macro to the exclude list for
	  when Intel compilers are used.

	* Fixed ROSE to permit use of Intel icc and icpc compilers to both
	  compile ROSE and serve as backend compilers for ROSE generated
	  code. Passes tests in my development directory.

	* Fixed ROSE/scripts/dotgen, dotgen2, and dotgenLetter; to test
	  for existence of GraphViz "dot" program so that ROSE can be
	  independent of the existance of "dot".  Requested by people
	  using ROSE and not interested in a long list of dependences :-).

	* Fixed SgConstructorInitializer for case of "new int()" does not
	  have a class declaration and as a result we have no way of
	  identifying that it is int type vs. any other primative type.
	  This was part of the use of SgDefaultType before a change
	  suggested by Jeremiah.  This class now stroes the type
	  explicitly and computes the class declaration where possible.
	  As a result the constructor parameters have been changed,
	  slightly.

	* Added tutorial example showing how to find the #define
	  directives.

	* Fixed relational operators in C to return SgTypeInt while in C++
	  they return SgTypeBool. Previously ROSE returned SgTypeBool
	  for both C and C++.  We fixed this for the case of C.

	* Fixed a few minor reported problems by Valgrind (now runs
	  cleanly; again).

	* Documented problem reported by Liao specific to why "class" does
	  not work in a *.C program compiled using -rose:C_only mode.
	  In the ROSE User Manual, on C++ modes (as I recall).

	* Fixed get_type() for SgStatementExpression which was not quite
	  correct, it returned SgTypeVoid and should instead have returned
	  the type of the last expressionStatement, if it exists, else
	  return SgTypeVoid.  so re return the default all the time,
	  with out investigating the last statement to sse if it should be
	  used.

	* Fixed which backend compiler is used by "-E" option when
	  compiling with "-rose:C_only" (previously called g++
	  regardless of if "-rose:C_only", and it should be calling
	  "gcc".

	* Fixed ROSE version commandline option "-rose:version" which
	  failed too easily (required filename to be specified!).

	* Added option to permit generated code to be marked with 
	  "#define ROSE_GENERATED_CODE" within the output code (requested
	  by Yarden at IBM).

	* Added test in EDG/Sage translation to verify that typeid()
	  returns type "const std::type_info" class.

	* Added Gary's qmtest scripts and documentation (to ROSE User
	  Manual).

	* Added Jochen's AST File I/O modifications.  Now the IR node
	  destructors have a valid body (automatically generated by
	  ROSETTA). Jochen's modifications handle where the memory pools
	  are cleaned up after file I/O (and before new files are read).
	  The destructors are no longer called on each node of the IR in
	  the memory pool since by definition (recent redefinition) the
	  destructor for an IR node can call delete on any of its data
	  members (this is controled in the definition or the IR, input
	  to ROSETTA).  Only parts of the IR node that are not traversed 
	  as part of the AST are deleted, so that a a tree traversal
	  calling delete at each IR node is sufficient to delete the AST
	  (except for share IR nodes such as types which ahve to be
	  cleaned up more directly; via memory pools).	Comment from
	  Jochen:
	     The problem was the deletion of the memory pools,
	     before reading in a new AST (also used for the AST
	     compression)! As the destructors work, a deletion started on
	     the root of an AST should delete all IR Nodes connected with.
	     Thus, I skipped my deletion and just call delete on the roots
	     of the stored ASTs. However, afterwards, I still have to call
	     clearMemoryPool, which does now only reset the freepointers
	     to be a ordered linked list without any jumps in it.
	
	* Fixed "g++: g++-E: No such file or directory" error in 
	  ROSE/tests/CompilerOptionTests/testCpreprocessorOption
	  directory. Needed a space between the compiler name and the "-E"
	  option.  Also fixed up code ti use the configure commandline
	  variable BACKEND_CXX_COMPILER_NAME_WITH_PATH and 
	  BACKEND_C_COMPILER_NAME_WITH_PATH.

	* Fixed SgAsmStmt case that not handled properly in sageInterface
	  function as required by AstCopy mechanism.

	* Fixed recognition mechanism for "-o filename.o" output file
	  option. This failed when provided directory names such as:
	  "test-opm".  this is not fixed to look only at the first two
	  characters of the option.  Fixed bug with multiple
	  specificication of "-o" options as well (fixed the bug
	  introduced when this bug was first fixed).

	* Isolated tests into separate directories (in development
	  directory). So that tests for C_tests, C99_tests, Cxx_tests,
	  C_subset_of_Cxx_tests, OpenMP_C_tests, boost_tests,
	  ExpressionTemplates_tests, colorAST_tests, copyAST_tests,
	  mergeAST_tests, PythonExample_tests, RoseExample_tests,
	  unparseToString_tests, UPC_tests.

	* Fixed SgEnumDeclaration::get_mangled_name(). Failed for case of
	  unnamed enum in a typedef in C.  C_tests/math.c, problem occured
	  for any C code using math.h.

	* Added OpenMP C test codes to a special test directory
	  (OpenMP_C_tests).  Some of these demonstrated a bug and
	  the bug was fixed.

	* Unified rose_edg_macros_and_functions_required_for_gnu.h and
	  rose_edg_macros_and_functions_required_for_icc.h so that we can
	  more easily support more compilers in the future.

	* Added handing for global qualification ("::") of types in
	  variable declarations.

	* Fixed handling of complex types for C, C99, and C++. Previous
	  solutions worked either for C and C99, or for C++; but not all 
	  three language modes.

	* Added in Jeremiah's work on stateless control flow graphs
	  (virtual CFG).  Added to be more tightly bound to the AST
	  and added a test directory with some test codes.  Testing
	  currently doen only for C++, but should not make a difference.

	* Fixed bug in handling of qualified names of variables in unnamed
	  namespaces (boost_tests/test_boost_lambda.C and test2006_121.C).

	* Added support for C and C99 complex operators
	    (+,-,*,/,+=,-=,*=,/=,==,!=).

	* Added C and C99 imaginary type (SgTypeImaginary).

	* Changed name of SgComplex to SgTypeComplex for consistancy

	* Added operators for mixed complex and imaginary arithmetic
	  (+,-,*,/) which can cause complex number to be generated from 
	  operations on floating pointer values using imaginary values.
	  (still need to fixup get_type() function to return correct
	  type (SgComplex) where used for mix floating-pointer and
	  imaginary operators. Only an issue for C and C99, not C++.

	* Fixed AST copy functions to skip setting parents of SgType IR
	  nodes.  SgType IR nodes are shared and have it is enforced that
	  their paranets are NULL valued pointers.

	* Fixed bugs in ROSE specific to compiling the new Virtual CFG
	  code in ROSE with ROSE.  This is part of new tests that compile
	  parts of ROSE (collections of ROSE translators) using ROSE.
	  This makes sure that ROSE can handle all the code in a simple
	  translator which includes all of the "rose.h" and everything
	  which that includes.

	* Added file option to specify CSV formated file of performance
	  information from separate phases of the compilation. Results
	  are output from existing performance monitors and accumulated
	  in file named using option 
	  (e.g -rose:compilationPerformanceFile ROSE_PERFORMANCE_DATA.data)
	  builds a file called "ROSE_PERFORMANCE_DATA.data" and
	  accumulates performance information in the file for (one set of 
	  data points; one data point for each phase of compilation) each
	  invocation of the ROSE translator.  User may use this mechanism
	  to define additional timers for their own program analysis or
	  transformation as part of performance monitoring.  Note that
	  this was implemented using file locking so that compilations
	  may be done in parallel (using the make: -j<n> option). The
	  invocation of each translator using this option adds a single
	  line to the target file (often a rather long line).

	* Fixed integer literals (types: int, long, long long, unsigned int,
	  unsigned long, unsigned long long, short, unsigned short) to
	  be saved as a string thus reserving any hex or octal formatting
	  and any suffix modifieds (e.g. LL,ll,U,u,LLU,LLu,llU,llu).
	  This is a continuation of work done (in this release) which
	  preserved all forms of floating-point numbers as strings for 
	  similar reasons.  This was work contributed by Rama.  Only
	  string literals are normalized (multiple strings are joined
	  to form a single string).  It is not clear if complex literals
	  are an issue, since they appear to be composed of
	  floating-pointer literals.

	* Fixed memory leak in ROSE, specific to how filenames were
	  handled in the Sg_File_Info object.  This was both a memory
	  and performance issue.  Sg_File_Info::get_filename() now
	  returns a const char* and get_filenameString() returns a 
	  const string. This was a contribution by a number of people.	

	* Changed ROSE to use the new interfaces  from the CVS version of Wave
	  instead of the deprecated interfaces.

	* Added normalization of all paths. Now all '-I'-directives,
	  '-L'-directives  and filenames will use absolute paths. This
	  work has been done to support the work on the copy unparser,
	  consistent filenames when reading binary files to construct a
	  whole AST and to support work on the Wave preprocessor.
	
	* Changed stripType(..) to be more flexible.

	* Fixed a memory leak bug which caused ROSE to leak memory every time
	  Sg_File_Info::get_filename() or Sg_File_Info::get_filenameString() is called.
	  This fix has changed the interface to return a 'const' values instead of non
	  const values. In particular this bug affected the AstSimpleTraversal since it
	  calls Sg_File_Info::get_filename() on every node during the traversal.

	* Added support for custom labels on nodes and edges to the whole graph
	  AST mechanism. This new feature is now supported for both the whole graph
	  of the memory pools and the whole graph of a node subtree.

	* Added interface to AstDOTGeneration to create a dot graph of a subtree
	  of a any AST node.

	* Added interfaces in StringUtilitity to do more filesystem
	  operations.

	* Added newer version of Peter's work on the transformation to
	  make implicit operation in C++ explicit (constructor calls,
	  destructor calls, base class constructor calls, etc.).

	* Added Andreas's work to make the paths to files referenced
	  within the Sg_File_Info absolute instead of relative (even if
	  specified as relative).  If an error is detected in the
	  conversion the file reference is left as relative. Also, #line
	  directives are not modified.

	* Fixed initialization of SgClassDefinition::p_packingAlignment
	  in non-ROSETTA-generated constructor.

	* Changed inferface of char* functions to use C++ style strings:
	     static char* getWorkingDirectory ();
             static char* getSourceDirectory  ( char* fileNameWithPath );
             static char* getPathFromFileName ( const char* fileNameWithPath );

	* Fixed use of fixed length C style string which caused stack
	  corruption for long filenames. Modified type of 
	  Unparser::currentOutputFileName to be a std::string.

	* Modified Unparser::getFileName member fucntion to return
	  "std::string" instead of C style "char*".
	
	* Fixed build system for PDFlib-Lite-6.0.2rv to improve build
	  process for ROSE (Andreas and Peter).

	* Fixed configure script for the '--with-gcj' option to fail if
	  '--with-gcj=yes' and gcj is not available (Andreas and Peter).

	* Added query of the memory pools to the AST Query mechanism (Andreas).

	* Improved speed of the AST Query mechanism (Andreas).

	* Modified configuration to have default prefix (set to `pwd`).

	* Modified configuration to build backend compiler specific header
	  files in $prefix directory.  This allows the install process
	  to finish the installtion of additional required files to
	  support the build tree being eliminated if required. This
	  fixes a problem reported by Boyanna at ANL.
	
	
	


	
2006-06-27 Dan Quinlan 0.8.8a
	* Fixed AST Rewrite bug that was specific to case found in only
	  3.4.3 header files (and which caused a bug only with g++ 3.4.3).

	* Fixed bug in AST file I/O (reading 20 binary files as once).
	  This was a bug found and fixed by Jochen, he sent us the fix
	  before we ever had the problem.  What a guy!

	* Fixed uninitialized SgProject::p_attributeMechanism pointer
	  (reported by Thomas Panas).

	* Added options to SgFile::usage() member function
	  -rose:collectAllCommentsAndDirectives and
          -rose:skip_commentsAndDirectives
	  with comments about why and how they are used.

	* Fixed compilation of dot2gml to be a configure option
	  to supportwhere it forced the installation of ROSE to be
	  dependent upon versions of bison (also the version of
	  bison used in our tests of ROSE is now specified in the 
	  ChangeLog.
	  
	* Added colorization to AST graphs and mechanism for generating
	  DOT graphs of the whole graph (of which the AST is a subgraph).
	  Most of this was work done by Andreas.  not added to the ROSE
	  Tutorial yet.

	* Fixed default constructors to be makred as compiler generated.
	  Need to finish this work so that generated operator=() and
	  destructors are similarly maked as compiler generated. Also
	  there are cases where the default constructor will not be built
	  this will be fixed soon, and is a normalization within ROSE
	  that we are working on with Brian White (Cornell).

	* Added work from Andreas to support Intel C++ compiler (icpc).

	* Added Persistant attribute DOT graph support (Andreas).

	* Added a number of fixes for the support of WAVE C Preprocessor
	  from Andreas. Current WAVE support is optional at configure
	  time.

	* Added support for more generalized name mangling (plus fixes to
	  the existing name mangling).  New function supporting this is:
	  std::string SageInterface::generateUniqueName ( SgNode* node, 
	  bool ignoreDifferenceBetweenDefiningAndNondefiningDeclarations );
	  (part of the SageInterface namespace).

	* Added more support for the color graphing of the whole AST 
	  (required to support debugging of AST Merge).

	* Fixed details within the ClassHierarchyGraph example (Andreas)

	* Added initial support for new version of AST Merge (ongoing
	  work), includes On-Definition-Rule verification (not yet in 
	  Tutorial).

	* Added destructors (automatically generated by ROSETTA) based 
	  on specification within ROSETTA as to if each delete should be
	  called for each data member.  This mechanism is built and tested
	  but at the last minute had to be commented out since it
	  interfered with the AST File I/O, this will be fixed in a future
	  release.  The consequence is only that the AST leaks memory if
	  deleted (deleting the AST is rare in general but useful for 
	  specialized internal tools (e.g. AST Merge mechanism).

	* Fixed bug in comments containing line continuation characters.
	  Rare as this is, it can cause preprocessor directives to be
	  output incorrectly relative to program statements (for example
	  see test2006_83.C). Fix was in preproc.lex.

	* Fixed collection of bugs found in ROSE and reported from a 
	  number of people.

	* Fixed labeling of C and C++ style comments (it was reversed).

	* Fixed indentation of #pragma in generated code.

	* Implemented #pragma pack sub-language (conforms to GNU, but EDG
	  does not handle some IBM specific variations/extensions).

	* Build a sys/cdefs.h file specific for ROSE which includes
	  the system /usr/include/sys/cdefs.h file and then uses
	  #define __flexarr [1]
	  to redefine __flexarr from [] to [1] to avoid variable length
	    array problem that causes:
	  struct __gconv_info __cd;
	  in "/usr/include/_G_config.h" to be improperly defined.

	* Fixed code generation for un-named structs to supress name
	  qualification (previously could sometimes output global
	  qualifier).

	* Fixed compilation of stdio.h and other common header files 
	  for C++, C, and C99. Each are now a part of the standard tests.
	  Details of C handling were broken in the previous release, and 
	  C99 mode was not tested.

	* Removed generation of SgNullStatement IR nodes within EDG/Sage
	  translation.  We still want to have SgNullStatement and
	  SgNullExpression IR nodes avalailbe for use in Sage III, but
	  they were being generated in unreasonable numbers in the AST
	  because they are a bit too common within the EDG AST.

	* Fixed function throw specifications, as in:
	  void foo_0() throw();
	  void foo_1() throw(int);
	  void foo_2() throw(int,long);
	  void foo_3() throw(int,long,bool);
	  Note that these can also be applied to function pointers as in:
	// Pointer to a function with a throw specification (not supported in ROSE)
	  void (*pf)(int) throw(std::string, int);
	  void (*pf_0)(int) throw();
	  void (*pf_1)(int) throw(int);
	  void (*pf_2)(int) throw(int,long);
	  void (*pf_3)(int) throw(int,long,bool);
	  But these are not supported in ROSE yet. It is not clear where
	  the information is about them in the EDG AST :-).

	* Added support to get compiler defines automatically and 
	  generate compiler specific include files for portability
	  across different architecures and compilers.  Better support
	  for 64 bit architectures using g++.

	* Initial support for Intel C++ Compiler (icpc).

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********



2006-04-23 Dan Quinlan 0.8.7a
	* Fixed many issues of multi-file handling
	  Backend was being called n-times for the whole list of n files!

	* Removed use of C style string (char* stuff) from SgFile and
	    SgProject IR nodes.

	* Fixed bug in compilation of Cxx_Grammar.C (first 200K lines of
	  ROSE to be compiled using ROSE).

	* Added memory pools to support fast file I/O for large
	  applications.

	* Fixed use of INFINITY in code generation (see test2005_175.C).

	* Fixed use of "unix" macro (was previously a predefined macro 
	  within EDG under linux).  This was an error, I think, since g++
	  permits it's use and so ROSE should as well. see test2005_176.C).

	* Fixed copy mechanism so that it works on whole program (still
	  fails some tests of interesting examples).  Works for trivial
	  programs currently.  Added mechanism to make sure that no shared
	  IR node is copied more than once. But the mechanism works on
	  whole projects and there is a simple way to test it directly.

	* Fixed handling of out-or-range floating point constants
	  We use the GNU compiler specific builtin  values:
	     __builtin_huge_valf()  // for float infinity
	     __builtin_huge_val()   // for double infinity
	     __builtin_huge_vall()  // for long double infinity
	     __builtin_nanf ("")    // for float quite NaN
	     __builtin_nan  ("")    // for double quite NaN
	     __builtin_nanl ("")    // for long double quite NaN
	     __builtin_nansf ("")   // for float signaling NaN
	     __builtin_nans  ("")   // for double signaling NaN
	     __builtin_nansl ("")   // for long double signaling NaN
	  If we were to have used values define in the C++ limits header
	  file the user would have had to have included this header file
	  in their application (which might or might not be true).  We
	  by using the compiler specific values directly we avoid this 
	  problem (but make the generated code GNU specific).  When
	  we generate code for other compilers we will have to address 
	  this.  Note that the ROSe generated code is GNU specific, but 
	  the ROSE implementation is not since we test for infinity, 
	  quite NaN, and signaling NaN by using general C++ mechanisms
	  (e.g. float_val->get_value() == std::numeric_limits<float>::infinity(),
	  as a conditional test for infinit value).  We just can't
	  generate such portable code unless we forced the generated
	  code to include specific header files (which would alos be
	  language dependent).  The code specific to this is in:
	     ROSE/src/backend/unparser/unparse_expr.C.

	* Fixed buffer size in lex parser to handle extreamly large
	    comments (Andreas demonstrated a code where the whole file
	    was commented out, this died due to inappropriate handling of
	    the C style comment.  The buffer size was 8K bytes, I have
	    increased the buffer size for comments and macros to 
	    10 megabyte (per comment). I have also added asserts to
	    enforce this limit so that if it is exceeded the problem will
	    be more clear.  Previously in would truncate the comment and
	    leave off the terminating "*/" so
	    it would cause an error in the generated code.  The current
	    fix expands the range of sizes for comments and enforces
	    (via ROSE_ASSERT) the the limits are observed.  There still
	    could be larger comments that we currently permit, but I 
	    am unclear as to how to make the implementation in the *.lex
	    file more robust.

	* Redefined va_start() macro:
	     from: void va_start(__builtin_va_list __builtin__x, void* __builtin__y);
	     to:   void va_start(__builtin_va_list __builtin__x, const char *__builtin__y);
	  This fixed test2005_165.C.

	* Added empty statement to be unparsed with each label
	  (SgLabelStatement). To handle the case where a label is used
	  without an associated statement ROSE will unparse:
	       "LABEL: /* empty statement */ ;"
	  to avoid generating cases without an associated statement.  The
	  "empty statement" represented by ";" is ignored and so will
	  not cause an error or change the semantics.  It seems that
	  this bug was what was preventing the code generated from f2c
	  from being compiled using ROSE (Andreas).

	* Added support for #warning in gathering preprocessor control
	  directives and comments.

	* Added support for unary plus operator

	* Fixed preproc.lex bug (see test2005_184.C and comments in
	  preproc.lex for details).

	* Added C99 support (turned on C99 support in EDG and added
	  support elsewhere within ROSE and the EDG/Sage translation).
	  It was a special problem for ROSE since the g++ implementation
	  of the complex<float>, complex<double>, and complex<long double>
	  use the GNU speicific "__complex__", "__real__", and "__imag__" 
	  type modifiers extensions; which are not supported by EDG.
	  The fix it to #define each of the type modifiers to "" and
	  then edit the complex header file to modify one of the 
	  private constructors which used the _ComplexT type (which is 
	  a typedef of a __complex__ float, double, long double type).

	* Added support for name qualification of enum values when they
	  appear in namespaces (previously worked fine for classes).
	  See test2005_183.C for example.

	* Fixed not SgCaseOption statements appearing in
	  SgSwitchStatement. The following code is legal C and C++:
	  switch(x) { int y; case 0: y = 1; break; }
	  The statement representing "int y;" was previously dropped.
	  This is now fixed, test2005_187.C has more details.

	* Fixed KOLAH bug reported by Andreas (test2005_181.C)

	* Fixed generation of correct template declaration where template
	  member functions appear in nested class (handles arbitrary depth
	  nesting now, just to be restricted to just non-templated member
	  functions of templated classes (zero depth).  See test2005_167.C
	  for more details.  Still one bug left to fix with respect to 
	  this test code (ROSE gnerates code for template instantiation 
	  that should be supressed, I will fix that later).

	* Added string to SgFloatVal, SgDoubleVal, and SgLongDoubleVal
	  classes as part of work with Andreas to record the actual
	  strings used for constants in the AST.

	* Added SgExpression* to SgValueExp class to hold root
	  of expression tree when constants are folded.  

	* Swapped order of ROSETTA's specification of the condition
	  and body in SgDoWhileStmt.  This allows the traversal
	  to visit the body first and the condition last (which is 
	  structurally more precise).  This also swaps the order of the 
	  constructor arguments, but this does not appear to be a 
	  problem for the SageIII code.  It could be a problem for
	  some user codes, but it does not appear to be a problem for any
	  that I am aware of (so far).  See test2005_114.C for details.

	* Fixed use of declarations in condition for SgSwitchStatement.

	* Fixed use of declaration for test within for loop (SgForStatement).

	* Moved data members to be generated by ROSETTA:
             static map<int, string> p_fileidtoname_map;
             static map<string, int> p_nametofileid_map;
             static int p_max_file_id;
	  Also build access function (by ROSETTA).  Modified
	  generation of Cxx_GrammarRTI.C to build operator<< for 
	  map<int,string> and map<string,int> objects.

	* Added SgQualifiedName to hold reference to scope used in
	  generating qualified names for names, types, and expressions.

	* Added SgQualifiedNameType as a wrapper for a SgNamedType
	  (identical in design to SgModifierType, SgPointerType, etc.).

	* Fixed Enum handling (definitions were output inappropriately
	  in some cases):
	     enum numbers { null }; typedef numbers local_null;
	  previously output the definition in the typedef.

	* Found the sizeof operator in the constant folded expression tree
	  and implemented the support for it in the IR, EDG/SageIII
	  translation, and the unparser.  This brings us a little closer
	  to being able to represent the original source code exactly.
	  Processing the constant folded expression tree in EDG continues
	  to be problem atic, so the robust way to handle input is with
	  this option OFF :-).  I will work on it more later.
	
	* Disabled PDFlib's auto-detect of Java, which can be re-enabled
	  by specifying '--with-java' at configure-time. Also removed
	  the verbose summary message displayed by PDFlib at
	  configure-time (work done by Rich).
	
	* Added support for switch case label ranges (see test2005_202.C).

	* Added support for calling "::operator new" and 
 	  "::operator delete" instead of just "::new" and "::delete"
	  or "new" and "delete" where they reference the global functions.
	  The case of "::operator new" shows up as a function call instead
	  of the SgNewExp IR nodes.  This is accurate.

	* Change name of "p_fileInfo" data member in SgPragma,SgFile, and
	  SgInitializedName to "p_file_info" so that automatically
	  generated functions (via ROSETTA) could be used and would match
	  the virtual Sg_File_Info* SgNode::get_file_info() member
	  function.  This avoids much redundency in access functions and
	  it was not clear why there would be two such similar functions
	  which lead to confusions.  ROSE was fixed in the few places
	  where this made a difference (nearly all in sage_gen_be.C).
	 
	* Updated ROSE/config/config.sub to permit use of ROSE on 64 bit 
	  linux machines (fix suggested by Michelle).

	* Fixed a number of places (5-7) in ROSE where pointers were cast
	  to ints (a significant problem for 64 bit machines). Reported
	  by Michelle.

	* Fixed a 3-4 places in EDG where pointers were output with %x
	  instead of %p.

	* Fixed a lot of bugs in the AST Merge mechanism, more work
	  remains (mostly worked for small problems but had not been
	  tested on larger applications).

	* Added tau specific example to ROSE/tutorial (tauInstrumenter.C).

	* Reorganized the ROSE documentation to be a self-contained 
	  directory with all HTML and Postscript documentations available
	  through valid links. Added ROSE Logo just for fun.

	* Added ROSE related publications to self-contained ROSE
	  documentation.
	
	* Added new namespace AST_FileIO with member functions 
	  IS_VALID_POINTER() and TO_BE_COPIED_POINTER(). This is
	  used in the IR node memory pool based allocation.  This 
	  the the namespace for Jochen's File I/O work. See Doxygen 
	  docs for more details.

	* Edited local copy of listings.sty (LaTeX support file)
	  to comment out us of lstpatch.sty. Also commented where
	  the change was done.  Might be required by developers
	  trying to build documentation, though thus far it has only
	  been a problem when building documentation on my laptop
	  (and not on my desktop machine).  Laptop is only ROSE
	  development platform running RedHat 4.0, others in CASC are 
	  still using RedHat 3.0, this may be the difference.
	 
	* Added typeTransformation specific example to ROSE/tutorial 
	  (typeTransformation.C).  This tutorial code demonstrates how to 
	  change floating point declarations using "float" to "double".
	  This example problem is important for FORTRAN use at LANL since
	  FORTRAN defaults to single precision where C defaults to double
	  precision.

	* Modified SgType IR nodes so that builtin_type is now a pointer
	  and all builtin types are built in the memory pools.  

	* Modified the global function type symbol tabel to be a 
	  pointer instead of a global IR nodes (in global scope).
	  Fixed access function to allocate the function type symbol table
	  if the static data member is NULL.  Static data member was added 
	  to SgNode.
	
	* Added test to make sure that there are no IR nodes allocated
	  before calling the frontend (no static constructors).

	* Added reset functions to SgModifier IR nodes to clear all
	  bits and reset to default values.

	* Fixed modifiers in the copy of the function declearation
	  held by a SgTemplateInstantiationDirectiveStatements.
	  C++ does not allow output of many modifiers (e.g. friend,
	  explicit, etc.).  Sage III represents the stucture of the
	  C++ source so function declarations referenced by a 
	  SgTemplateInstantiationDirectiveStatements must reset
	  all modifiers.

	* Removed macros from sage3.h because it effected all header files:
	       macro for "Boolean" defined as "int"
	       macro for "NULL_FILE" defined as "SgNULL_FILE"
	       macro for "NO_UNPARSE_INFO" defined as "SgNO_UNPARSE_INFO"

	* Modified generation of Sg_File_Info in tutorial to use
	  Sg_File_Info::generateDefaultFileInfoForTransformationNode().


	* Changed name of config.h to rose_config.h and it is included by
	  sage3.h.  So all source files no longer need:	
          #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
             #include <config.h>
          #endif
	  Thus user's using ROSE need not include this either.  Since the
	  name has been changed there is no longer a config.h so it would
	  be incorrect to do so.  I expect this will be a problem
	  initially for users of this version of ROSE.  We could provide
	  a dummy config.h which included rose_config.h to make the 
	  transition easier, but this it would break later.

	* Fixed Control Flow Graph code (ROSE_CFG.C) to skip building 
	  empty basic blocks when confronted with
	       "int n=0; for(; n > 10; n++)"
	  where the SgForInitStatement has an empty list.  Previously
	  this case cause a NULL pointer in the AST, now fixed.  And the
	  fixed caused the empty basic block to be built.  Other empty
	  basic blocks are built in the CFG, but these are less of a 
	  problem, or at least didn't cause a bug in the PRE using
	  pass3.C.

	* Removed UnparseOrigFormat class and associated functions
	  in unparse_format.h and unparse_format.C.

	* Changed the function interface for some of the unparser functions
	  to make a pointer to a SgFile and SgProject instead of a
	  reference. The goal is to have a constistant interface as much
	  as possible.

	* Fixed output of SgLabelStatement so that if it is the last
	  statement in the scope (excluding SgNullStatement) then
	  a ";" will be output.  This is required for g++, but not for
	  EDG. I am not clear on what the standard requires here, but 
	  since g++ requires it I have fixed up the code generation.
	  The example which demonstrates this is test2005_164.C.

	* Fixed AstInterface::GetScope(SgNode*) function to use the
	  internal (non-structural) get_scope function and handled
	  the few special cases requires (input scope if SgScopeStatement
	  is alwasy correct now).

	* Fixed bug in new implementation of AST Copy Mechanism
	  (reimplented from Qing's initial work).  Forgot to 
	  copy values for SgValue expressions (at least for SgStringVal).

	* Changed SgStringVal to hold a C++ style std::string instead of a
	  C style string.  This was an overdue minor fixup to the API.
	  Now the constructor can be automatically generated by ROSETTA.

	* Added Jochen's AST File I/O, this is a significant contribution.

	* Added a number of Andrea's projects (fix this up later).
	     * Boost Wave support is added bug not working properly yet.
	     * Whole AST graph output is supported (see tutorial).
	     * Lots more stuff ...

	* Added Lingxaio's support for comments and CCP directives to 
	  be gathered for all header files (used to be supported only 
	  for the source files).

2005-10/12  Richard Vuduc 0.8.6c

	* Added ROSE-HPCT, a module to annotate an AST with data collected
	using the HPCToolkit developed by Rice. See
	projects/roseHPCToolkit/README for an
	overview. (projects/roseHPCToolkit/*)

	* Fixed underquoting errors in various autoconf macros, which
	were being reported when using the most recent versions of the
	GNU AutoTools. (config/*.m4, acmacros.tar.gz)

	* Removed extraneous debugging messages in PDFlib-Lite build.
	(src/3rdPartyLibraries/PDFlib-Lite-6.0.2rv/makedist.sh)

2005-10/10  Richard Vuduc 0.8.6b

	* Upgraded PDF library to PDFlib-Lite v6.0.2, from 3.0. The old
	PDFLibrary is still included in the distribution, but is no longer
	referenced during the build process. This upgrade required
	modifying the build system for PDFlib-Lite to work seamlessly with
	the ROSE build system because PDFlib-Lite expects the source and
	build trees to be the same (see
	src/3rdPartyLibraries/PDFlib-Lite-6.0.2rv/ChangeLog-rv). It also
	required minor changes to the existing PDF generation tree
	traversals due to PDFlib's interface changes. (build,
	config/Makefile.for.ROSE.includes.and.libs, configure.in,
	src/3rdPartyLibraries/Makefile.am,
	src/3rdPartyLibraries/MSTL/PDFGeneration.C,
	src/3rdPartyLibraries/PDFlib-Lite-6.0.2rv/*, src/Makefile.am)

	* Removed some unnecessary files, including unneeded object files
	and Emacs backup files from the source tree. (*.o, *~)

	* Removed a reference to 'mkinstalldirs' in config/Makefile.am,
	because more recent versions of GNU Autotools do not require
	it. (config/Makefile.am)

	* Fixed a make rule in the dot2gml module.
	(src/roseIndependentSupport/dot2gml/Makefile.am)

	* Fixed a make command which required the user to have a "." in
	her path.
	(exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/simpleTranslatorExamples/exampleMakefile.in)

	* Modified QRose build files to permit proper distribution of its
	source during 'make dist'
	(src/roseIndependentSupport/graphicalUserInterface/src/QR*/Makefile.am, src/roseIndependentSupport/graphicalUserInterface/src/QRGui/icons22/Makefile.am)

	* Fixed a portability-bug in which 'unistd.h' was not being
	included. (tests/roseTests/astPerformanceTests/testPerformance.C)

2005-09-12 Dan Quinlan 0.8.6a

	* New IR nodes added in the last year (not all in this version 0.8.6a)
             SgNamespaceDeclarationStatement
             SgNamespaceDefinitionStatement
             SgNamespaceAliasDeclarationStatement

             SgDirectory
             SgDirectoryList
             SgClassType
	  someone ask for this list.

	****** (12/7/2004): Commented out tests in:
	  ROSE/projects/arrayOptimization/tests (not clear what the
	  problem is here, likely must discuss this with Qing).
	  It appears that the tests in the tests directory are done before
	  the source files in the arrayOptimization directory are
	  compiled!

	* Added relational operators for Sg_File_Info objects
	  (part of testing of source file position information required
	  for copy-based unparsed).  

	* Added tests of startOfConstruct() and endOfConstruct()
	  for each SgStatement (part of testing of source file position 
	  information required for copy-based unparsed).

	* Modified construction of directory graph for ROSE
	  (note that directories with "++" are ignored within the
	  exclude list):
	     $(top_srcdir)/scripts/lsdot $(top_srcdir) --format=ps --exclude='CVS\|PetscCode\|PerlEnabledTestingFramework\|NEW_EDG\|boost_1_31_0\|KOLAH\|KULL\|pythonDir\|TRASH\|coco\|Analysis\|AstProcessingLib\|AST_RewriteMechanism\|autom4te.cache\|BJMmacros\|dqDevelopmentDirectory\|ContainerParallelizer\|EDG\|ExamplePreprocessors\|g++_HEADERS\|GNU_HEADERS\|include\|LoopProcessing\|msDevelopment\|MSTL\|NEW_EDG_3.0\|OmpPragmaParser\|ProgramAnalysis\|ROSETTA\|SAGE\|TransformationSpecification\|util\|testDoxygen\|ckpt\|OLD_aterm-bundle-2.2' --basename -o=roseDirectoryMap.ps;

	   If this graph gets too large then LaTeX failes to process the
	   file. I have excluded Boost from the graph (was in my
	   development directory).

	* Added support for qualified names for function reference
	  expressions.

	* Added support for friend functions within function reference
	  expressions (which should not be qualified).

	* Added support for type modifiers (e.g. "const") when used with
	  typedefed types in declarations (types derived from declarations).
	
	* Added support for recognizing implicit casts within initializer
	  expressions and supressing the generation of explicit casts
	  within the ROSE generated code. This makes unparsed code much
	  more precisely replicate the original source code.  Previously,
	     std::string *s = NULL;
	  would unparse as:
	     std::string * = (std::string *)(0);
	  but now unparses as:
	     std::string * = (0);
	  The difference is more dramatic with the much longer types 
	  present within Kull (deeply nested template types).

	* Added support for more complex qualified name handling
	  (see test codes test2004_132.C - test2004_136.C).
	  Does not appear to have fixed the problem with Kull 
	  however :-).

	* Reordered pre-initalization list for SgInitializedName and
	  SgVariableDefinition constructors that we explicitly defined
	  in the ROSETTA/Grammar/*.code files.

	* Fixed bug in terminal.C to prevent output of initialization of
	  data members that contain an empty initialization string.
	  This eliminates pages of warnings when compiling Cxx_Grammar.C.

	* Fixed inlined New_File_Info() function in
	  ROSETTA/Grammar/statement.code to use the copy constructor
	  for Sg_File_info so that the filename, AND line number AND
	  column number would be copied (instead of just the filename).
	  this allows for more accurate information about source file
	  position, that is at most off by a line or so. The column
	  number is the least accurate information as a result of the
	  use of the copy constructor to build a Sg_File_Info object.
	  We will try to make the source position information more
	  accurate over time, but EDG does not store all source location
	  information so some information may not ever be exact (constants,
	  for example, do not have EDG source position information.

	* Oddly enough, some types are automatically translated by EDG to 
	  be in the std namespace without the namespace ever having been
	  explicitly visited.  This appears to be part of the C++
	  standard.  For example, the first apearance of the va_list
	  is represented internally as std::va_list (even though no
	  "namespace std" has appeared.  Although this appears to
	  be true, I can't generate the behaviour in a small test code!
	  After a little more work it is clear that this is bizzar.
	  The special case of va_list handling is now implemented within
	  the EDG/Sage translation.  The following comment is added to the
	  code:
            // DQ (11/21/2004): Added support for non-standard typedefs and the case of builtin va_list
            // this case of builtin va_list type generates a type which is in the std scope but for which 
            // we may not have seen the namespace std yet so the SgScopeStatement is not been generated.  
            // The comments in the code below make it clear the EDG does special processing of the stdarg.h 
            // file and never really parses it so that we can see the namespace that is defined in it.  
            // This is all very EDG specific non-standard C++ processing and so it is represented as a 
            // special case in the EDG -> Sage III translation.  And of course it was an ugly thing to 
            // finally find and debug!  For our purposes we can ignore the whole thing (defering to header 
            // files and the EDG front-end to handle this correctly).  Ignoring it might mean that the 
            // symbol tables within Sage III might be missing references to va_list, but it is not clear 
            // that any compile handles va_list in a standard way.


	* Fixed conversion operators (used in SWIG generated files)

	* Fixed address operator (used in SWIG generated files)

	* Fixed cases of template parameters being pointers to existing
	  defined types (see test2004_144.C). The first bug was when the 
	  pointer was of a class type (non-template).  the second bug was
	  when the pointer was of a templated class (instantiated
	  template class).  Generated demonstration of typedefs being 
	  unparsed using the base type instead of the alias type (see
	  test2004_145.C).

	* Rewrote unparsing of variable declarations to be refactored,
	  shorter, clearer, and to handle qualified names for
	  SgInitializedName objects.

	* (12/3/2004): Added Alin Jula's ROSETTA generated destructors
	  to ROSE.  Later commented out all locations where we forced the 
	  use of explicitly built destructors.  So ALL ROSETTA generated
	  classes now use the generated destructors.  However, at present
	  I have disabled the deletion of any member data from ALL
	  generated classes.  This will be turned on in a incremental way
	  at some point.  

	* The developersScratchSpace/Dan/preprocessor.C used to test
	  the source code (previous bugs and work in progress) now
	  implements the traversal to delete the parts of the AST that
	  are traversed.  Note that only the traversal as Markus designed
	  it to be used work here, all other attempts to call the 
	  get_traversalSuccessorContainer() member function, fail at some 
	  point (not sure why that would be)!

	* (12/4/2004) Fixed memory leaks in EDG.  It turns out that EDG has no fix
	  for most of these since it only is able to free it's memory
	  regions (which is a significant part of the problem, but not
	  enough).  So the solution was record all mmeory allocated to
	  an STL list (and remove elements reallocs and freed
	  explicitly).  Then after the EDG phase is done we free all
	  memory in the STL list (and the STL list itself).  This works
	  well and appears to be robust in compiling large applications.
	  However, it fails to work with theAST rewrite mechanism, so 
	  the whole think it turned off until I get a chance to debug that
	  part. 

	* DQ (12/6/2004): Note current rewrite mechanism is not working 
	  (even though other tests pass) because the scopes of newly
	  generated IR nodes fron the string based AST generation do not 
	  have scopes set correctly! Also the EDG memory can not be freed 
	  for the rewrite system to work!  Everything else appears to work.

	* Added directory path of source file to paths specified with
	  -I in compilation with back-end compiler (e.g. compiling the
	  rose generated file using g++).  So that we get the effect of
	  searching the source file's directory for header files even when
	  compiling the generated source file with the back-end compiler.
	  This is a little bit of a tricky details which forces many
	  header files defined with the source file to not compile within 
	  Kull.

	* Fixed long standing problem that the object file generated from
	  backend copilation was previously rose_<original file name>.o.
	  Backend compilation now correctly generates an object file
	  with the name <original file name>.o, just as would any
	  compiler. Note that the name can still be over ridden by the
	  specification of an object file name using the "-o" option.

	* Renamed ROSE/src/frontend/SageIII/sageSupport.[hC] to
	  sageInterface.

	* Built namespace (SageInterface) for location of all interface
	  functions which manipulate the Sage III AST directly.  
	  Name was agreed to by Dan, Qing, and Rich.

	* Moved set_name() member function of SgInitializedName class to
	  be a member of the namespace SageInterface.  The get_name() and
	  set_name() member functions are now generated by ROSETTA (as
	  they shuld be), and have the usual semantics.

	* Fixed handling of explicitly defined member operators operator*() 
	  operator->() and operator[]() so that they unparse to form 
	  correct code. It was only some strange mixed cases of there
	  use together that was a problem. For example:
               class A
                  {
                    public:
                         A();
                         A( int *x, int y);
                         int & operator[](int i);
                         A *operator->() const { return Aptr; }
                         A& operator*() const  { return *Aptr; }

                         A*  Aptr;
                         A** Aptrptr;
                  };
               A a;
               A* aptr = &a;
               A** aptrptr = &aptr;
               aptr->operator[](1);
               (*aptr)[1];
               (*aptrptr)->operator[](1);
               (*(*aptrptr))[1];
               (aptr->Aptr)->operator[](1);
               (*(aptr->Aptrptr))->operator[](1);

	    // The following two statements are exactly the same (but expressed with different syntax)
               a->operator[](1);
            // This is the same as the statement above but using operator syntax
               a.operator->()->operator[](1);
            // Here, "a[1];" is really the same as "a.operator[](1)", but we want 
            // to unparse it as "a[1]" to keep the generate code simple!
               a[1];
            // This is correct code, but caused an error in the unparser!
               (*(a->Aptr))[1];
            // This is a meaningless statement but is legal C++ (C++ trivia)
            // Note that it is the same as "a->;" but this is not legal code! (this now works in ROSE!)
               a.operator->();
               a->Aptr;
               a_pointer->operator->();
               a_pointer->operator->()->Aptr;
            // Note that "(*a_pointer)[1];" and "(*a)[1];" are not the same (since one is the derefencing 
            // of a pointer and the other is the derefence operator, "operator*()", called on the object!).
               (*a_pointer)[1];
               (*a)[1];
            // Also, these are the same (if A defines such operators as operator*() and operator[]()).
               (*a)[1];
               a.operator*().operator[](1);

	* Added extra data member to SgInitializedName object so that when
	  the SgInitializedName object is used within a
	  preinitialization list (for constructors) any template names
	  can be reset from mangled forms (such as "A____L9" to
	  "A<int>").  Initialized names in preinitialization list are now 
	  classified as virtual_base_class, nonvirtual_base_class, and
	  data_member (meaning not a base class).  This fixes another bug 
	  in Kull.

	* Removed assertion that required curr_source_sequence_entry != NULL
	in sage_gen_cast() of EDG/Sage III translation.  Casts appearing
	in global scope (with no functions (other scopes) declared) caused 
	assertion to fail (code was too simple to have been caught previously).

	* Modified configuration to copy ROSE/config/Python-version-2.2.h
	  to the compile tree ROSE/g++_HEADERS directory.  Later we can
	  make a non-g++-specific directory for such header files that 
	  ROSE requires.  At the moment Python is the only special case.  
	  Within this fix the Python.h header file is modified to 
	  include "#include <iostream.h>" at the top of the file.
	  This is required to force many g++-specific macros to be defined
	  (which must be explicitly defined in ROSE to mimic g++).
	  Python in general does not like to have system header files
	  include before it's own header files since it appears to
	  redefine some of them (very silly design move in my opinion!).
	  This is all required because we are compiling Kull, and Kull
	  uses SWIG, and SWIG generated files include Python.h.
	  The configuration code to copy the Python.h file into the
	  g++_HEADERS directory is located at the end of the 
	  ROSE/config/create_system_headers file.  Since I'm testing ROSE
	  will Kull and Kull is using Python version 2.2, I have used the 
	  version 2.2 Python.h header file.  This can be changed by
	  modifying the configuration code that does the copy.



	* Added support in unparser for unary oparators:
	       operator&(), operator*(), operator|(), operator~()
	  When these were binary operators they were being confused as
	  unary operators.  C++ allows them to be used as both unary and
	  binary operators.


	* Adding support for template functions parameter lists which don't
	  help select the required specialization.
	         template <typename T> void foo();
	  must be called as: 
	         foo<int>();
	  since the function parameter list is insufficent to select the 
	  specialization required. This issue appears for templated member
	  functions as well (but not for member function of templated
	  classes).  
	  One general question: How do we know when to include the 
	  template arguments in the templated function name? Clearly
	  they are redundant when the function parameters are sufficient
	  to select a unique specialization.  For now we will always
	  append the template parameters to the templated function or
	  member function name, to be safe.


	* Added more error checking ROSE_ASSERT to SgFunctionParameterList
	  generated code.  


	* Added support for specification of compiler generated code (e.g
	  implicit cast operators) which don't exist in the source code
	  and yet exist in the AST without correct filename, line or
	  column location data.  e_compiler_generated filed added to 
	  Sg_File_Info::classifier enum (required access functions were
	  also added, setCompilerGenerated(), unsetCompilerGenerated(),
	  and isCompilerGenerated()).  These are set in the EDG/Sage 
	  interface code.

	* Fixed many details of support for expressions of pointers to 
	  functions and data members which mixed overloaded operator->(),
	  operator*(), and operator&() with the normal C++ ->,*,&
	  operators.  

	* Removed special case of parenthesis handling within the 
	  precedence evaluation for the C++ dereference operator and the
	  overloaded operator*() (overloaded dereference operator).
	  This eliminated the need to force the addition of parenthesis
	  within the unparsing of SgDotExp and SgPointerDerefExp.
	  this whole area of work is particilarly tedious.

	  Example test code includes (see test2004_149.C test2004_159.C and test2005_08.C):
	       class X {
                    public:
                         X & operator+ ( const X & x );
                         X *operator->() const;
                  };

               int foo() {
                    X x;
                 // All three of these statements are identical (different syntax for the same function calls) 
                 // They generate an error "error: parse error before `+' token"
                    x->operator+(x);
                    (*(x.operator->())).operator+(x);
                    (*(x.operator->())) + x;

                 // This is similar to just saying "x;" but with a function call to accomplish it!
                    (*x.operator->());  // This works properly
                    x.operator->();
                 // x->;  // note that this is not allowed in C++ (but would be the same as the previous statement)!
                  }

	  Generates following lines of code for function foo above
	  (note that all of the parenthesis are required):
	       (*x.operator->())+x;
               (*x.operator->())+x;
               (*x.operator->())+x;
               *x.operator->();
               x.operator->();

	* Fixed use of nested template names in function and class names
	  (filtered EDG generate names to eliminate occurance of ">>"
	  in nested template names).  Fixed for member functions, and
	  class names, but might not be fixed uniformally within EDG/Sage
	  connection.

	* Fixed support for function pointers of typedefed member
	  functions (see test2005_10.C).

	* Fixed handling of file info objects for arguments of member
	  function pointers where the function type is a typedef type.
	
	* Added field to SgTemplateArgument to record if the template
	  argument appears explicitly in the source code.  Then we only
	  output those template arguments that appear explicitly.  This
	  fixes two problems:
	     1) when to use template arguments in the names of template
	        functions and member functions (where function parameters
	        don't resolve which overloaded function to call).
	     2) when the expanded template arguments include references to 
	        private types of a class (test2005_12.C).
	  However, it appears that this EDG information is not always
	  correct! So I have output all template arguments, until it is
	  fixed in EDG.

	* Fixed unparsing of types to form template arguments so that
	  definitions would not be unparsed.  Added SgUnparse_Info
	  object and set appropriate internal flags in the SgUnparse_Info
	  object so that definitions would be skipped.  See test2005_14.C.
	
	* Added comment about fix to getTypeName() which returns "enum"
	  for an SgEnumType instead of the name of the enum type. Tom
	  Epperly is fixing this and will send me the fix.
	 

	* fixed name mangling for pointers to autonomous classes hidden in
	  typedefs. 
	       typedef struct {
	           int            id;          /*identifier of the compound array */
	          } *XYZ;
	       extern XYZ *functionReturningXYZ(void);
	  In this case the function type was mangled with the wrong name
	  (incompletely mangled since the return type class name was empty
	  (since it was hidden in a typedef)).  The solution was to detect
	  such empty names and use the name of the typedef instead (so
	  that there would be a valid name to use in the mangling and so 
	  a valid name to use as a key in the hash table for the function
	  symbol table to avoid collissions with other function having
	  different return types.

	* Fixed handling of unspecified initializers as in:
	       X *x5 = new X[i+j];
	  and
	       X *x3 = new X[2];
	  which use the default arguments (none) for initialization.

	* Fixed unparsing of #include files within SgBasicBlock
	  lists of statements.  Previously we didn't check for the
	  file name to match the unparsed file and the statements in the 
	  include file were unparsed plus the include directive which
	  caused for multiple definitions of each variable declaration.

	* Fixed accuracy of ending position of closing brace in
	  SgBasicBlock (was being overwritten in the EDG/Sage connection).

	* Fixed unparsing of statments in SgBasicBlock which didn't check
	  to see if the file name associated with each statement matched
	  the current file. Was a problem for the example code below.

	* Fixed handling of comments (and particularly #include directives
	  when they appear at the end of SgBasicBlocks and must appear
	  before the closing brace.  Example code (test2005_27.C):
	       #include "test2005_26.h"
	       void foo()
	          {
	            #include "test2005_26.h"
	          }
	  The senario above is not correctly handled for SgBasicBlock,
	  SgClassDefinition, SgNamespaceDefinition, and SgEnumDeclaration.
	  This should be all the relavant cases.

	* Fixed handling of "operator>>" which is an exception to
	  when we process EDG names containing ">>" to generate "> >"
	  to generate correct nested template names.  Clearly 
	  "operator>>" should never be processed into "operator> >".

	* Fixed handling of character literals.  Previously these
	  were output as there interger values (not very clever). Where
	  such character literals were used to function parameters, 
	  this would cause the wrong function to be resolved (one taking
	  and "int" instead of a "char" (or perhaps no function would be
	  found to resolve, since there is no auto type promotion from
	  integer to char (since precission would be lost)). the unparser
	  was modified to correctly out put charater literals and the 
	  cases of  '\0', '\1', '\2', '\3', '\4', '\5', '\6', '\n', '\t', 
	  '\v', '\b', '\r', '\f', '\a', '\\', '\'', '\"', char(127) are handled
	  explicitly (as required). Note that ASCII DEL character literal
	  has no name in C or C++ (I thnk) so it is handled as a special case of
	  a decimal cast to a char (C++ trivia). See test2005_31.C for
	  details. Note that octal and hexademimal char literals
	  (e.g. '\127' and '\x000') are normalized to their ASCI character 
	  or C++ name equivalents (e.g. 'W' and '\0', respectively).

	* Fixed handling of "in-class initialized static const integer
	  members."  It seems that static const integer (or char, long, 
	  etc.) data members may be alternatively initialized directly
	  within the class.  When they are declared this way the use of
	  such variables will be normalized by EDG to put into place of
	  the named constant the conatant value.  Constant propogation.
	  Interestingly this only applies to integer types (including
	  char, long, short, enums etc., but not float or double).
	  In general it appears that integer based constants are special
	  some constants are more special than others :-).  In this case
	  the AST presenting is the data member access is constructed and
	  a constant insterted at the last moment.  The direct traversal
	  and generation of Sage III forces the generation of an AST which
	  literally translates to x->42 (due to a number of bugs, each
	  of which had to be fixed. What EDG wants to generate is x,42
	  as an expression, using the comma operator.  What I have done is
	  ignored the generation of the AST representing compiler
	  generated use of the comma operator and just generated the
	  42 as a constant expression instead.  Example codes showing 
	  valid C++ code using in-class initialization of static const int:
	       class X
	          {
		    public:
		      // Notice that we can initialize static constants within the class!
		         static const int ultimateAnswer = 42;
		  };
	       void foo()
	          { 
	            X x; 
	            var = X::ultimateAnswer; // generates "var = 42;"
	            var = x.ultimateAnswer;  // generates "var = 42;" but used to be an error
	          }
	  The test code test2005_32.C shows more interesting examples.

	* Fixed bugs in ROSE represented by test codes test2005_33.C
	  through test2005_42.C.  

	* Added test code from Andreas (Diffpack problems) test codes 
	  test2005_43.C through test2005_49.C. All passed but one
	  (test2005_48.C) demonstrates a comment put in the wrong place 
	  within a union.

	* Fixed up the configuration so that
	    --with-alternate_backend_Cxx_compiler=
	  could be use to specify a path to a specific compile (such as
	    --with-alternate_backend_Cxx_compiler=/usr/apps/gcc/3.4.3/bin/g++
	  where the g++ is stripped off (using `basename /usr/apps/gcc/3.4.3/bin/g++`
	  to generate "g++" for internal comparision agains supported
	  backend compilers.  Previously the compiler was specificed such as
	       --with-alternate_backend_Cxx_compiler=g++
	  but it was not possible to specific a different version than the
	  one in your path.  this is helpful since we want to compile KULL
	  using the 3.4.x version of the g++ compiler, even though we use
	  the 3.3.2 version for compiling ROSE itself.  The two don't have
	  to be the same and this allows them to be different.  Several
	  locations in the configuration files had to be modified to make
	  this work (but it was not hard, if the now works).  Note that 
	  the header files are generated from the version of the compiler
	  used by the backend compilation (or so I hope).

	* Fixing up header files so that the 3.3.x header files can be
	  used (currently they generate an warning where __GNUG__ and
	  __GNUC__ = 3 are defined because __flexarr is defined as "[]"
	  instead of "[1]" (because the /usr/include/cdefs.h forces the
	  wrong definition for GNU (I think).  EDG catches the warnings
	  which GNU does not.
	  This code (from /usr/include/cdefs.h is wrong, I think):
	/* Support for flexible arrays.  */
	#if __GNUC_PREREQ (2,97)
	/* GCC 2.97 supports C99 flexible array members.  */
	# define __flexarr	[]
	#else
	# ifdef __GNUC__
	#  define __flexarr	[0]
	# else
	#  if defined __STDC_VERSION__ && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L
	#   define __flexarr	[]
	#  else
	/* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  */
	#   define __flexarr	[1]
	#  endif
	# endif
	#endif

	  The best solution i have is to define __flexarr to [1] and 
	  live with the warning about the redefinition.

	* Fixed empty namespace definitions (which appeared first in the
	  g++ 3.4 header files).

	* Added GNU extensions (turned them on in EDG and added required
	  code to support them in ROSE).  This eliminated the requirement
	  to patch any of the gnu header files which simplifies their
	  use within ROSE (and make the use of ROSE less sensitive to
	  different versions of g++). ROSE had become overly fragile
	  and dependent upon g++ version 3.3.2 n the previous release.

	* Added header file ROSE/g++_HEADERS/rose_edg_macros_and_functions_required_for_gnu.h
	  and used EDG mechanism to force this header file to be read
	  before any other so that we could define numerous macros and
	  functions required (and not set by EDG) for GNU compatability.
	  Some are specific to use with the 3.4 header files.

	* Modified macros defined on commandline to the internal EDG pass
	  within ROSE.  We not correctly extract the GNU specific
	    variables so that the gnu header files can be correctly 
	  interpreted by EDG (which sets some of these incorrectly, like
	  __GNUC_MINOR__ and __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__.

	* Removed special handling for Python.h, which is no longer
	  required because of the new level of compatability between
	  ROSE and GNU.  So we no longer need to copy a special modified
	  version of Python.h into the ROSE system header files. this
	  also fixed a strange bug in ROSE (test2005_54.C).

	* Fixed output of function of template classes, function templates
	  and member function templates to avoid output of trailing "<>"
	  in their function name.  The substring is useless if no template
	  arguments are explicitly specified.  Plus "std::endl<>" is a 
	  bug in g++ version 3.4.3, though not versions of g++ previous to
	  3.4.x.  So this effected the compilation of Kull in 92 files.

	* Fixed quoted strings specificed on the command line when used
	  with a backend compiler which does not handle quotes well (such
	  as /usr/local/bin/mpiCC on LC machines).  The problem is fixed
	  in ROSE/src/ROSETTA/Grammar/Support.code and has the following comment:
	       // DQ (4/14/2005): Fixup quoted strings in args fix "-DTEST_STRING_MACRO="Thu Apr 14 08:18:33 PDT 2005" 
	       // to be -DTEST_STRING_MACRO=\""Thu Apr 14 08:18:33 PDT 2005"\"  This is a problem in the compilation of
	       // a Kull file (version.cc), when the backend is specified as /usr/apps/kull/tools/mpig++-3.4.1.  The
	       // problem is that /usr/apps/kull/tools/mpig++-3.4.1 is a wrapper for a shell script /usr/local/bin/mpiCC
	       // which does not tend to observe quotes well.  The solution is to add additional escaped quotes.


	* Removed SgFunctionDeclaration data members:
	      SgFunctionDefinition *forwardDefinition; and
	      SgFunctionDefinition *definition_ref; 
	  since they are redundand with the pointers to the defined more
	  generally in SgDeclaration (thus for all declarations):
	      SgDeclarationStatement *firstNondefiningDeclaration; and
	      SgDeclarationStatement *definingDeclaration;
	  
	* Fixed support for SgFunctionDeclarations use of the 
	      SgDeclarationStatement *firstNondefiningDeclaration; and
	      SgDeclarationStatement *definingDeclaration;
	  This was on a list of things to do and now this mechanism works
	  the same for SgFunctionDeclarations as for SgClassDeclarations
	  and SgTypedefDeclarations. I think that was all that was left.

	* Added new IR node for explicit template instnatiation
	  directives. Modified ROSETTA input, EDG/Sage connection code,
	  and unparser to generate the directives.  Force fixing of 
	  defining vs. nondefining declarations for function declarations
	  (see above).

	* Added fixup of defining and nondefining declarations for all
	  declarations in ROSE/frontend/SageIII/ASTFixes.C.  This code
	  fixes a problem where the second forwad declaration cannot
	  be reached to set its defining declaration pointer properly
	  when the defining declaration exists.	

	* Fixed explicit instantiation of template member functions.
	  Supressed redundent output of specialized template member
	  function.  This whole subject of when to output the specialized
	  versions of template classes, functions, and member functions
	  (and likely a few other contructs) needs to be reviewed (I
	  think).

	* Fixed output of long double (was just plain wrong!).  

	* Fixed output of float, double, and long double to fix
	  precision (set to 12, 24, 48; respectively).  Trailing 
	  zeros and roundoff error appear to be automatically removed
	  by the stream operators.  So slightly over specifying the
	  precision seems to provide the best results.

	* Found the location of the original expressions used within
	  constant folding within EDG.  Plase a comment there but later
	  we can suplement the SageIII AST with the exact constant
	  expression allone with the constant folded value which we 
	  presently store.  I think that the SgValue object could be
	  extended to include a pointer to the original constant
	  expression.  Providing both within the AST is best since it
	  permits both program analysis to know the constant folded value
	  while permiting the source-to-source translation to output
	  exact constant expression values.

	* Set FRIEND_AND_MEMBER_DEFINITIONS_MAY_BE_MOVED_OUT_OF_CLASS to
	  FALSE in EDG (host_envir.h).  This removes the previous
	  normalization of functions defined in classes being defined 
	  outside of the class (it also simplifies how we generate code
	  for templates which will compile properly (definitions were out
	  of order).  The problems with this are non-trivial.  I have had
	  to fix numerous bugs assosciated with the use of variabled
	  before they apear in declarations (common within member
	  functions which use variables defined lower down in the class).
	
	* Fixed references to static data members use in functions
	  appearing before their declaration.

	* Added get_qualified_name() member function to
	  SgFunctionDeclaration (see test2005_70.C).
	  This test code shows that the same function can be defined in
	  two different namespaces, only the qualified name would
	  distinguish them.  This test code was not previouly an error,
	  but demonstrated an interface issue (lack of symmetry).

	* Removed SgSymbolPtrList (since we compute qualified names on the
	  fly to permit simpler handling of transformations!).  This was
	  part of an early trial implementation qualified name handling
	  that was not a very clever idea.  We now compute qualified names
	  on the fly, though this requires storage of the scope for nearly
	  all declarations.  the scope is required since C++ declarations
	  and definitions can be quite separated and possibly ambiguous.

	* Fixedup ROSETTA to handle SgDirectoryList objects as STL
	  containers.

	* Added SgDirectory IR nodes as part of initial work to support
	  whole programs to be read in and built into a single AST.
	  We will see just how large a program we can support (even if
	  any global analysis that required significant memory would be
	  likely impossible).  this would greatly simplify simple quires
	  of a whole project.  This will be implemented over a period of
	  time, first step is to add the IR node (the simple part).

	* Added Doxygen custom HTML header and footer (to specify
	  documentation as being "DRAFT").

	* Removed redundant isPartOfTransformation boolean in Sg_File_Info
	  and fixed up implementation of gneral classification mechanism
	  for IR nodes (isCompilerGenerated or isTransformation).
	  The member function get_isPartOfTransformation() and 
	  set_isPartOfTransformation() are implemented to use the newer
	  classification mechanism and are also depreicated as well.

	* Deprecated several member functions from ROSE class
	     char* ROSE::getFileName           ( SgLocatedNode* locatedNodePointer );
             int   ROSE::getLineNumber         ( SgLocatedNode* locatedNodePointer );
             int   ROSE::getColumnNumber       ( SgLocatedNode* locatedNodePointer );
             bool  ROSE::isPartOfTransformation( SgLocatedNode* locatedNodePointer );
	  These were introduce before the Sg_File_Info object existed at
	  each SgLocatedNode and when error handling was previously
	  required.  These part of SAGE III is not cleaned up and verified
	  through separate AST consistancy tests and so these function are
	  no longer required.  Removing them is part of general cleanup
	  within ROSE (and part of the support for the node classification
	  mechanism by which nodes are marked as compiler generated or
	  part of a transformation.

	* Found access to more detailed template information by setting
	  PROTOTYPE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_IL to TRUE in EDG's host_envir.h
	  file.  We might set this later to permit greater flexability
	  over the handling of templates.  Here is where we finally see
	  template parameter data structures (or so it seems). See note.
	
	      // DQ (6/1/2005): Reset this to false since it is causing redundent declarations of template data members 
	      // in the global scope because after processing a SgTemplateDeclaration no associated SgTemplateDefinition 
	      // is defined to hold the associated data members).  Not clear that we need this, though it would permit 
	      // transformations directly on the templates themselves (instead of storage of just the template string).

	*Fixed EDG processing of command line to permit calling the
	 edg_main() function repeatedly to generate multiple ASTs as
	 part of support for AST merging.

	* Fixed use of comma operator (where SgExprListExp was previousoy
	  used).  See test2005_84.C for details.

	* Wrote prelinker using EDG mechanism (nm, etc.) but gave that up
	  since the end result was not very robust.  Then implemented a
	  better prelinker, currently not using the SQLite data base,
	  but it will after that work is finished.  The current
	  prelinker operates on a file and determins in a fixed pointer
	  iteration which classes, functions, and member functions 
	  need to be instanatiated.  This work is in ASTFixes.C at
	  present.

	* Fixed SgBaseClassList to ba a list of pointers to SgBaseClass
	  objects.  This is the last list of object to not be a list of
	  pointers to objects making the IR more uniform and without
	  this single exception. The list of SgBaseClass object is still
	  not traversed, this would be a problem since there is alread a
	  list in the the SgClassDefinition class.
	

	* Added explicit support for scope to the SgEnumDeclaration
	  Enum declarations can require name qualification
	  to support the identification of functions taking enum types.
	  Since the EnumType must then be qualified the declaration must
	  support name qualification even though it's definition does
	  not appear separately from it's declaration (by the C
	  standard). To support the name qualification we have to rely
	  on either an explicit representation of the scope, or use the
	  parent information (from get_parent() member function).
	  Because we want to use this within the name mangling during
	  construction of the global symbol table for function symbols
	  (during the EDG/Sage III translation), and the parents are
	  only properly and consistantly set after the EDG/Sage III
	  translation (see AstFixes.C), we must store the scope
	  explicitly in the AST.  Too bad we have to store it
	  explicitly, we nearly didn't need it. This fixes a bug in the
	  function symbol table construction where symbols from function
	  types are shared and functions with close but not identical
	  functions types were sharing the same symbols because the
	  generated names failed to include the qulified names in the key
	  used to hash the function symbols in the global table. This
	  lead to nearly the correct generated code, but subtle errors,
	  difficult bugs to fix until template specializations of STL
	  code failed to compile and provide tests cases (overly complex
	  test codes which were distilled into test2005_93.C and test2005_94.C

	* Added many tests to AstConsistencyTests.C

	* Added documentation about ASt properties enforced within
	  AstConsistencyTests.C
	

	* Deactivated test in ROSE/tests/roseTests directories while we 
	  sort though the effects of changes to the AST (mostly adding new
	  explicit scope pointer to many SgDeclarations and the
	  SgInitializedName IR nodes.  Commented out directories include:
	       astInliningTests 
	       astOutliningTests
	       loopProcessingTests
	       programAnalysisTests
	       programTransformationTests
	  Not clear how much these can be addressed in current work before
	  the next checkin?

	* Modified everywhere that SgNULL_FILE is used to instead call the 
	  new static member function of Sg_File_Info which generates a
	  default object appropriate for use with transformations.
	  "Sg_File_Info::generateDefaultFileInfoForTransformationNode()"
	  As a result the tests in:
	       astInliningTests 
	       loopProcessingTests
	       programAnalysisTests
	       programTransformationTests
	  now work and pass.  The tests in astOutliningTests are left
	  commented out (as Qing had left them).

        * Added use of SQLite (Radu)

        * Added support for AST Merging (Milind)

        * Added Interprocedural slicing (Milind)

        * Added more call graph support (Radu)

        * Added class hierarchy graph support (Radu)

        * And many more which are not documented here :-).

2005-9/3 Dan Quinlan 0.8.5a

	This is the first phase of a two phase checkin to update to
	reflect the latest work to handle the compilation and linking 
	of Kull (the lab's largest and most complex C++ application).
	
	This version added Gabriel de Figueiredo Coutinho's QRose GUI
	interface to ROSE. Before we release ROSE formally we need to 
	likely disconnect QRose from ROSE because of license issues
	relative to the QT GUI interface library.  Gabriel will be
	updating his QRose library over time and might maintain it 
	seperately.  It is a great piece of work and is currently
	folded into ROSE so that we can easily use it and deomonstarted 
	it within the tutorial.

	This version also adds the work from Andreas, both the data
	structure mapping and the newer implementation of Nil's 
	dotGL viewer which Andreas and Nil's figured out how to install
	using newer libraries.

2005-4/26  Dan Quinlan 0.8.3b
	* Fixed copy permissions of libraries used for copying EDG
	  binaries.
	
	* Fixed version number to 0.8.3b since I fixed additional details
	  regarding the build of ROSE distibutions using EDG binaries.
	  Version 0.8.3a was sent to someone and this version updates
	  that version.
	
2005-4/25  Dan Quinlan 0.8.3a
	* Added support for use of binaries of EDG in place of source code
	  when building distributions.  The process is to from a
	  development version of ROSE (what you check out from CVS):
	     1) run "build" as usual
	     2) configure with the option "--with-edg_source_code=true" in
	        addition to any options that you specify.
	     3) run make, make check, etc.
	     4) before building a distribution, if you want to build the
	        distribution to use EDG binaries then rerun configure
	        without the "--with-edg_source_code=true" option (or with it set
	        to any other value but "true").  Then run "make dist"
	        or "make distcheck".  If you want to use the EDG source
	        code then don't rerun configure.
	   Note also that the make distcheck will now use the 
	   DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS variable to communicat the value of 
	   $with_edg_source_code when distcheck runs configure.  So if
	   you build a distribution with binaries using distcheck, it will
	   be tested as a distribution using the binaries.  And
	   alternatively, if you build a distribution using EDG source
	   code (with the distcheck rule) it will be tested as a
	   distribution using the EDG source code (not binaries).
	   The binaries are only stored in the distribution if
	   they are specified, this makes the distribution quite large
	   (approx 40 meg).

	   Note that the default behavior now is to exclude the EDG source
	   from distributions and that as a result a configure option
	   "--with-edg_source_code=true" is required to build EDG when
	   checked out from the CVS repository.  This ONLY effects
	   developers, but there are a few people using ROSE who have
	   access to the CVS and use ROSE the same as those doing
	   development work on ROSE.  Those with a distribution that does
	   not have the EDG source code (and uses the binaries that are
	   contained in the distribution) will not see anything
	   different).

	* Added error checking and help messages to detect incorrect use
	  of "--with-edg_source_code=true" configure option.

	* Added Andreas Saebjornsen's work on data structure
	  vizualization, the alternative EDG source-to-source build, with
	  no SageIII added (instrumented by Andreas's to support
	  vizualization of the EDG AST, which is useful for debugging).
	
	* Fixed the latest work required to use dotgl, the tool for
	  vizualizing dot graphs the size of a football field (really
	  really large ones).  This is work by Nils Thuerey.

	* Added notes on how to use ROSE with OS X (from Markus and
	  Boyana). See ROSE/NOTES_FOR_OSX.

	* Added ROSE Tutorial, still in development.  The tutorial
	  includes over a dozen examples of small ROSE applications which
	  do different sorts of tasks, together with input codes and the
	  output from each example (using the specificed input).  

	* Moved some redundently named files:
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTGraphInterface.h
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTSubgraphRepresentation.h
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTSubgraphRepresentation.C
	  to
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTGraphInterface.h.redundant_file
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTSubgraphRepresentation.h.redundant_file
	     ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics/DOTSubgraphRepresentation.C.redundant_file
	since they already existed in:
	     ROSE/src/3rdPartyLibraries/MSTL
	and lead to problems when the wrong version clobbered the correct
	    versions when copied into ROSE/include during "make install"
	This caused "make installcheck" to fail.  These are Nil's vesions
	of some files that Markus had originally.  I understand that
	Markus added the features that were lacking in Nil's original
	version so that we no long require Nil's version, but I'm not
	certain.

	* Removed the chapter on the tutorial from the User Manual
	and made the ROSE Tutorial a separate document.  This is because
	it was exceeding the capacity of LaTeX (too many figures).

	* Fixed up get_qualified_name() to be consitant on all nodes where
	    it is implemented (union of scope and name, for named IR
	    nodes).

	* Added support for global qualifier "::" in typedefs.

2005-1/24  Dan Quinlan 0.8.2a
	This check-in is separate from the check-in of the latest template
	work (representing the newest work on Kull).  That will be next 
	over 90% of Kull compiles, and I want to finish the rest and
	then fix details that new required features of the IR have broken
	in the AST Rewrite Mechanism (then I will check that work in).
	
	* Added edg_prelink mechanism to ROSE so that we could avoid
	  calling as a separate utility.  Calling it as a separate
	  utility required ROSE to know the path to the compiletree for
	  ROSE or the install path (no mechanis was available to select
	  one or the other).  Previously ROSE translators worked because
	  the path to edg_prelink (in the ROSE/frontend/EDG/EDG_3.3/util
	  directory) had to have been set.  This was a difficult
	  constraint to explain and enforce and verify.  So now it is
	  removed as a constraint.  The problem became more obvious to
	  me when showing Gary Kumfort how easy ti was to install and
	  use ROSE (it was not and this was part of the problem).

	* Removed misleading comment from edg_prelink.c which appeared
	  to report an error when there was none.  Error reported that
	  there was no *.ti file (template instantiation file) associated
	  with the input file (only happened when there was no object file
	  name (-o option) specified.

	* Added option in Makefile.am (must be uncommented) to permit 
	  compilation of a standalone version of the EDG front-end NOT
	  using SAGE.  To build this version you must uncomment the line
	       # SKIP_SAGE= -DBACK_END_IS_SAGE_GEN_BE=0
	  within the Makefile.am.  NOTE THAT ALL OF EDG/src MUST BE
	  RECOMPILED to make this work. Several warnings about this are
	  present in the Makefile.am and are output if trying to compile
	  the standalone EDG program (edgFrontEnd), run "make clean" to
	  remove all files.  Use "make edgFrontEnd" to compile the
	  standalone frontend program which uses only EDG.  This 
	  mechanism is provided to support work that Andreas is doing 
	  (Norway) and also support testing and debugging; if it does not
	  compile with EDG, then it will not compile using ROSE :-).
	  This option can also be uncommented directly in the makefile
	  (instead of the makefile.am).  More comments are contained in
	  the Makefile.am within ROSE/src/frontend/EDG/EDG_3.3/src.
	  The default is to compile EDG for use with SAGE (using SAGE).

	* Within the EDG/EDG_3.3/src directory I have built both a static
	  and dynamic library.  The technique used to do this fits
	  better within automake which has previously complained in 
	  each directory about building a *.so library (invalid name).
	  I expect that automake wants to encourage us to use libtool,
	  but I have not had good success with libtool previously so I 
	  would like to not do that.  The techniques used builds both a *.a
	  and a *.so library, which is likely a good idea anyway and it
	  does not take much time to build the *.a library (less than a
	  second) so it may work well.  This technique may be used else
	  where witin ROSE in the near future (if it works well).
	  Just for the reconrd this configuration stuff is REALLY tedious
	  and boring, even if it is important for end users :-).

2004-11/11  Qing Yi 0.8.1a
        . Removed the duplicated storage of data members in various SgNodes when these members
          are already stored in a decendent of the current node. As the result,
          some previously available member access functions in various SgNodes are no longer
          available and need to be translated or removed, including:
              SgReturnStmt:  get/set_return_expr_i   -> get/set_return_expr
              SgExpressionStmt: get/set_the_expr_i -> get/set_the_expr
              SgForStatement:   getInitializerStatement->get_for_init_stmt
                                get/set_test_expr_i ->get/set_test_expr
                                get/set_increment_expr_i ->get/set_increment_expr
              SgSwitchStatement: get/set_item_selector_i -> get/set_item_selector
              SgCaseOptionStmt: get/set_key_i  -> get/set_key
              SgAsmStmt:    get/set_expr_i  -> get/set_expr
              SgSpawnStmt:   get/set_the_func_i -> get/set_the_func
              
              SgFunctionDeclaration: set_mangled_name() -> 
                     remove because it is no longer required before calling get_mangled_name()
              SgInitializedName: get_named_item()  ->
                     remove because now the double-initializedName situation in 
                     Variabledeclarations has been fixed.
           Further, some constructors  of the above SgNodes now take fewer argument.
        .  Removed p_named_item pointer from SgInitialized name, so SgInitalizedName
           nodes no longer exist in pairs in variable declarations. Further,
           pointers to VariableDefinitions are stored inside SgInitializedName.
           Pointers to declarations are no longer explicitly stored because they are 
           always the parents, or grandparents of SgInitializedName. 
           The old interface remains except get_named_item. 
        .  Renamed some conflicting names in generating member access functions. including
              SgForStatement:  p_init_stmt -> p_for_init_stmt, accessible through get/set  
        .  Removed the initializer pointer in SgVariableDefinition, since it is already 
           stored in SgInitializedName
        .  Rewrote member access functions in ROSETTA Statement.code, so that all
           member accesses goes through the ROSETTA/Grammar/dataMemberAccessFunctions.macro
           templates, which track the modificatioin of members.
        .  Removed declaration pointers in FunctionDefinitions and 
           ClassDefinitions, since the declarations are always parents of the definitions.
           The old interface remains. 
        .  Added new member access function macros in ROSETTA/Grammar
        .  Deactivated astOutlining, both source directory and test directory,
           because its compilation issues regarding usage of SAGE nodes. 
           Reinstalling (in the next checkin by Alin) the directory requires 
           modifying the following makefiles:
            ROSE/src/Makefile.am
            ROSE/config/Makefile.for.ROSE.includes.and.libs
            ROSE/exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/simpleTranslatorExamples/exampleMakefile.in
            ROSE/src/midend/astOutlining/Makefile.am
            ROSE/tests/roseTests/Makefile.am
            ROSE/tests/roseTests/astOutliningTests/Makefile.am
        .  Added support for copy-unparsing: when statements are not changed,
           they are unparsed by copying from the original source file.
        .  Added support for tracking the modification of SAGE IR nodes.
        .  Restored tests in programAnalysis and others, deactivated by
           0.8.0.a, after fixing various problems.

2004-10-23 Dan Quinlan 0.8.0a

	* Fixed up handling of documentation between development and
	  distribution versions of ROSE.  Only a development version of
	  ROSE (a version of ROSE checked out from CVS) can be used to
	  build documentation.  Distributions versions of ROSE (what
	  user's get e.g. ROSE-0.7.8a.tar.gz) can not be used to build
	  documentation, to do so would place a significant configuration
	  burden upon developers trying to add and maintain the
	  documentation.  To make up for this, both the HTML and LaTeX
	  documentation is build by the "make dist" rule and the files
	  ROSE-0.7.8a-HTML-Docs.tar.gz and ROSE-0.7.8a-UserManual.ps 
	  are included in the distribution (in ROSE/docs/Rose).

	* Added macros to permits use of GNU attributes (new feature of
	  GNU compilers).
	     #define ROSE_DEPRECATED_FUNCTION __attribute__ ((deprecated))
	     #define ROSE_DEPRECATED_VARIABLE __attribute__ ((deprecated))
	  These macros will help us communicate to users as we migrate
	  to a better intrface within some parts of SAGE III.

	* Added AST test of new type traversal (work still in progress).
	  This traversal uses the standard traversal to traverse non-type
	  and non-symbol IR nodes and then uses nested traversals to
	  explicitly traverse several, but not all types.

	* Fixed function SgFunctionRefExp and SgMemberFunctionRefExp to
	  have the correct Sg_File_Info information.  Previously they
	  referenced the function declaration and not the use of the 
	  function.

	* Fixed file information built for all value expressions
	  (constants, etc.).  Previously there was none, since EDG does
	  not save file information for constants, but it was possible to
	  extract it from the expression before the constant was
	  processed and pass the Sg_File_Info objects along to where the
	  Sage III value expressions are built. Previously in a test code
	  with 35,000 IR nodes, 10,000+ had the default values for the
	  source position information, now only 2 IR nodes have the
	  default information (both IR nodes appear to be compiler
	  generated so they would not have any corresponding source
	  position information anyway.

	* Fixed bug in generation of DOT files from Qing's graph
	  interface.  Details are in the DOTSubgraphRepresentation.C.
	    // DQ (8/14/2004):
	    // This fixes an long outstanding bug in the use of the DOT interface classes with Qing's graph 
	    // interface. The DOTSubgraphRepresentation<> class does not have a dotout data member
	    // the DOTRepresentation<> (the base class) does have a dotout data member and direived class
	    // should not delete the base class's data member.  It would work if we had set the pointer to
	    // NULL after deleting it (a habit that I very much like and which would have avoided the
	    // bug, but it is better that the derived class not delete the base class data members.
	    // delete dotout;

	* Removed use of old SageII SgAttribute mechanism.

	* Removed old SageII SgPragma mechanism.

	* Moved string getVariantName ( VariantT v ) to new
	  sageSupport.[hC] file.

	* Removed get_variantName(int v): redundent with getVariantName(VariantT v)

	* Deprecated SgLocatedNode::getFileName() (access function for "get_file_info()->get_filename()")

	* Changed return type of virtual int variantT() const; to virtual VariantT variantT() const;

	* Deprecated (funtions now defiled as below):
	     virtual int variant() const ROSE_DEPRECATED_FUNCTION;
	     virtual int getVariant() const ROSE_DEPRECATED_FUNCTION;

	* Removed functions that used old SageII attribute mechanism:
	     int SgStatement::get_suppress_global($GRAMMAR_PREFIX_$GRAMMAR_X_MARKER_TemplateInstantiationDecl *node);
	     void SgStatement::output_pragma(ostream& os);
	     void SgStatement::set_pragma();
	     void SgExpression::set_lvalue();
	     void SgStatement::set_suppress_atomic();
	  I think suppress_atomic() access functions were part of the
	  old CC++. New boolean variables have been added to permit marking
	  of expressions as an lvalue (not tested yet).

	* Removed support for pragmas at the expression level (do we need
	    this?)  We need to visit this issue and perhaps unify the
	    existing support for pragmas on statements and expressions.

	* Make the default to generate developer level Doxygen
	  documentation.  This allows the default generated documentation
	  within a automatically generated distribution to be built
	  properly.  This option may be changed in the future, but since
	  the Doxygen documentation for ROSE is currently under
	  development (thanks to new suggestions and work with Alin Jula)
	  it make more sense to have the default be the more complete
	  version of the documentation (even if it presents more of the
	  interfaces than we would want to present to users. The previous
	  setup (with default being the user documentation) presented too
	  little to be useful, this version likely over compensates by
	  presenting a bit too much, but I think this is still an
	  improvement.  Any suggestions about documentation are welcome.
	
	* Implemented verbose modes to take an integer parameter.  
	     -rose:verbose 0 is the same as the default without the option
	     -rose:verbose 1 generates a minor amount of I/O feedback
	     -rose:verbose 2 generates more I/O
	     -rose:verbose 2 generates still more I/O (currently maximal)
	  By default ROSE now generates no output (just like g++).
	  This is important when some options are used (generating 
	  dependence rules for make for example with gnu g++ -mm 
	  option.

	* Added test in ROSE/tests/CompilerOptionsTests/A++Code
	  for quiet output (default) for ROSE translator.  No 
	  output is permitted now for translators without setting
	  -rose:verbose n (where n is greater than 0).  Any output
	  from a ROSE translator causes the test to fail.

	* Fixed use of iostream.h in ROSE/tests/CompileTests/A++Code/A++_headers.h
	  to include <iostream> (with new C++ header file naming scheme).

	* Implemented automated processing of the GNU 3.x g++ header files for
	  the case where the GNU g++ compiler is used as the backend
	  processor (see comment in ROSE/config/create_system_headers,
	  below). We previously used the GNU 2.96 header files when the 
	  GNU g++ backend was selected, and while this worked well for
	  nearly a year or more, recent test codes that I have created
	  have demonstrated errors associated with the inconsistant use
	  of the 2.96 and 3.x header files.  Only a problem for C++, not
	  for C. Comment in code:
	     # DQ (8/28/2004): The gnu-3.x-headerfile-fixup.pl is used to process the backend compiler's
	     # header files as required.  For some systems no processing is required.  However, for GNU
	     # there is some processing (non-standard features) which the g++ compiler implements just to
	     # be able to process its own header files.  Since we can't implement these language features
	     # in ROSE, we process the header files to remove or fixup the the non-standard parts of the
	     # header files.  In general the header files match the header files associated with the
	     # backend compiler used with ROSE.
	  see perl script ROSE/config/gnu-3.x-headerfile-fixup.pl for details.

	  Note that the new 3.x header files still generate several
	  warnings (below), which I don't know now to avoid.  In case
	  anyone is interested in playing with this.  The new header files 
	  also demonstrate at least on bug in ROSE regarding proper
	  pushing and poping of scopes internally (which is a higher
	  priority at the moment).

	  Current warnings generated using 3.x header files (after
	  automate processing):
	  "/home/dquinlan2/ROSE/LINUX-3.3.2/g++_HEADERS/hdrs1/limits", line 285: warning:

              { return -__LONG_MAX__ - 1; }
                       ^

	* Namespace position in source is tricky in EDG, the position of
	  the namespace is the position of the first declaration of the
	  namespace and not subsequent namespaces.  And there can be
	  multiple declarations of a single namespace (in the same
	  namespace)!.  The namespace "std" is the best example of this
	  in the compiler's header files (particularly the 3.x gnu header
	  files where it appears over and over again, so that more
	  functions and types can be added to the std namespace.  As 
	  a result the source location of the start of a namespace is
	  easy to get wrong and I got it wrong, but now it is fixed.
	  There is also a test to make sure the that start of a namespace
	  appears in the same file as the ending "}" of a namespace.
	  This caught many errors, for which there was a single fix,
	  once I found it :-).

        * Fixed handling of source sequence lists so that we now always
	  traverse to the end of the list (previously we had stopped
	  prematurely in a particular case which only came up when using
	  std lib functions with namespaces and templates).  This was 
	  debugged as part of support for the new 3.x gnu header files.

	* Turned on handling of "restrict" keyword in EDG, part of STL
	  STL support (STL uses restrict internally).

	* Fixed many more namespace details.

	* Fixed pragma handling, #pragma is now allowed almost anywhere 
	  within the source program.  Exceptions where #pragma is not
	  allowed are:
	       for (int i=0; i < 10; i++)
	    #pragma not allowed
	          {
	          }
	       switch (i)
	    #pragma not allowed
	          {
	          }
	  Not clear if these are worth allowing, currently they report an 
	  error in ROSE, which seems sufficient.  Test code: test2004_15.C
	  tests use of #pragma in lots of different locations.
	

	* Added several specific functions to SgName
	    string SgName::getString() const;
	    friend SgName operator+ ( const SgName & n1, const SgName & n2 );
	    SgName SgName::assembleQualifiedName(const SgName & scopeQualifiedName, const SgName & localName);

	    The assembleQualifiedName() function makes sure that no
	    leading "::" is introduced when scopeQualifiedName is empty
	    (as it is for a SgGlobal and SgBasicBlock).

	* Reimplemented namespace and using declaration and using
	  declaration, since they were much more complex that I
	  originally understood them to be. We now use more of the
	  information in the EDG AST and this eliminates having to
	  implement name lookup (which is REALLY complicated in the
	  standard, much more that I expected), so use EDG!

	* Eliminated get_namespace() function in EDG/Sage III connection
	  code.  This reduces the dependence upon the parent pointers
	  being set properly, since there is now one less location where
	  they are used. In the better design, all information is obtained
	  directly from the EDG AST so that the complexity of the
	  namespace and using statement handling is greatly simplified.
	  All declarations are found from symbols previously stored in
	  the EDG AST.  This design makes even more clear why the
	  connection of Sage III to EDG must be done top down! I would
	  not know how to evaluate namespace handling bottom up, without
	  it becoming more complex :-).  Eventually we hope to only
	  set the parent pointers in a post processing phase.

	* Fixed pointers to member data (which were confused in the
	  EDG/Sage connection and in the ROSE unparser as being pointers
	  to member functions).  See test code test2004_86.C for tested
	  examples. Problem occured in compiling Boost header files.

	* Implemented support for vacuous destructor calls in EDG/Sage
	  connection and in the unparser.

	* Fixed EDG/Sage connetion code which tended to get to the end of 
	  the source sequence list and yet still tended to assert that 
	  curr_source_sequence_entry != NULL and use the NULL value
	  which caused many errors.  test2004_81.C 82.C now tests this
	  for at least a commonly occuring case in STL and Boost.

	* Implemented const pointer to member function in EDG/Sage
	  connection. There are 15 different types of constants
	  (several const addresses, values, int, float, and many more ...).
	  It was shocking to see all this, but all are now implemented and
	  several are tested (likely only the Plum Hall test suite can be
	  relied upon to test all of these).  Test2004_83.C demonstrates
	  the code from Boost which started this adventure.

	* Added transfomation to compiler header file processing to remove
	  "extern template" GNU g++ extensions from all the version 3.x 
	  header files.  "extern template" was related to what is now
	  "export" and was an old GNU C++ extension.  For our purposes in
	  ROSE we could substitite "extern template" with "template"
	  this is now done automatically at configure time when the 
	  backend compiler's header files are copied and translated
	  for use by ROSE.  this is done by a Perl script (discussed
	  above).

	* Modified behavior of configure time processing of header files
	  so that this is now always done.  so rerunning configure
	  rebuilds ROSE compiler header files (generating them from 
	  those used by the backend compiler, often GNU 3.x in development).
	
	* Testing compilation with Kull demonstrated that the GNU
	  implementation of "string" didn't compile using EDG (was not
	  valid C++ as EDG understood it).  since the GNU header files
	  have and use several GNU C++ extensions this is not very
	  surprising. I figured out a minimal modification of the GNU
	  basic_string.h file which implements basic_string (which is
	  typedefed to "string" for users).  The fixes are represented 
	  as a patch (in ROSE/config) and the patch is applied to the
	  basic_string.h file during the header file translation done
	  at configure time.  Reruning configure redoes the translation.
	  The use of the patch seems to work well, and we have to figure
	  out the details of generating patches to support future work
	  with KULL anyway.

	* Implemented support for use of constructors not explicitly
	  defined by the user for classes and templated classes. Stored
	  symbols were missing since the functions had never been seen,
	  symbols are now internally generated (including even template 
	  declarations!).

	* With previous work on forcing symbols to be generated when found
	  to be mising in specific cases, internal testing was made more
	  strict to report any possible symbols not found during
	  processing. Correct behavior is to abort if any symbol that
	  should be found is not found (assertion that all symbols exist, 
	  unless it is reasonable that this is a first use or discovery,
	  in which case the symbol is built and attached to the EDG AST
	  for furture Sage III processing).

	* Fixed placement of some template symbols (for template
	  functions) was placed into the EDG routines (reserved for
	  template function instantiation symbols (thus some symbols
	  were overwritting previously (correctly) placed symbols).
	  This was fixed and now all template symbols are placed into 
	  EDG template structures within the AST.

	* Implemented support for throw to handle three different kinds of
	  throw (previously only one was implemented). Added enum to
	  indicate which of the three is used. Added support in 
	  ROSETTA/src/expressions.C file for additional data members,
	  SgThrow constructor now takes additional parameters.

	* Fixed support for "throw" expression to support concept of
	  rethrow of previous exception (specified using "throw;").

	* Added support for throw as a exception_specification
	  (specified using list of types "throw (T1,T2,T3)").

	* Implemented support for unparsing different throws in 
	  ROSE/src/backend/unparser/unparse_expr.C (incomplete
	  implementation for function throw modifier in case
	  where a exception-specification throw is specified
	  (e.g. "void foobar() throw(T1,T2);").

	* Fixed handling of "()" in throw expressions
	  "throw (className());" compiles with EDG, but not with g++
	  so fixup to unparse as "throw className();".  Note
	  that "()" were a previous problem with constructors
	  "className X();" requires an explicitly defined default
	  constructor (with some compilers, EDG and g++, I think)
	  where as "className X;" will work whether the default
	  constructor is explicitly defined or not.  This was 
	  some of the original reasoning (justification) for the
	  special handling implemented in parenthesis handling
	  the last time I checked things in (7/22/2004).  It is
	  interesting how many places parenthesis are required to
	  not be present to be valid C++ code.  I have however not
	  consulted the C++ standard (on order, not arrived yet).

	* Fixed unparsing of typedefs of function pointers, previously:
	       typedef void *(*swig_converter_func)(void *);
	  unparsed to be:
	       typedef void * *(*swig_converter_func)(void *);
	  Added logic to the unparsePointerType for unparsing "*"
	  to match logic used to know when to unparse the type
	  of the function.  Bug and details represented in test2004_93.C.

	* Fixed previous fix which broke other code :-(.  Now the 
	  current fix passes internal tests of ROSE.  The current 
	  fix is that the explicit unparsing of the return type of
	  function and member function pointers in typedef declarations
	  is eliminated.  It appears that this should not have ever been
	  put in previously.  Now the case of function and member function
	  pointers can likely be unified with the case of non function and
	  nonmember function pointers (but this has not been done, yet!).
	  The previous fix has been removed!

	* Added support in util/string_support.h for numberToString()
	  functions for pointers, and unsigned int.

	* Added more debugging support in the unparser (can be turned on 
	  at the top of the unparse_stmt.C, unparse_expr.C, and 
	  unparse_type.C.

	* Added support for defining and non-defining declarations.
	  Marked the declaration as a forward since we are not in a part of the EDG/Sage 
	  connection code which generates class definitions and so this can not be a defining declaration!
	  If later in processing it happens that this function has been called from a function which 
	  generates a defining declaration then this will be made the first non-defining declaration and a
	  new declaration will be built (not marked as forward) and it will be make the defining 
	  declaration and this declaration will be updated to reference it as the defining declaration!
	  Thus the defining and non defining declarations will be available from each declaration and the
	  non-defining declarations will be shared and the defining declarations will not be shared!

	* Fixed SgTemplateInstantiationDeclaration to only accept a
	  SgTemplateInstantiationDefn as a definition (previoustly
	  we were using the SgClassDefinition with SgTemplateInstantiationDeclaration
	  which was not quite the right thing to do.  The 
	  SgTemplateInstantiationDeclaration now has a set_definition()
	  member function which takes a SgTemplateInstantiationDefn
	  and hides the base class set_definition() member function.
	  This enforces that the correct handling is done and caught
	  one location in the EDG/Sage inferface where this was not 
	  being handled correctly.

	* Removing the parent side-effect of ROSETTA generated set_xxx() 
	  access functions (not complete yet). this has required that
	  I set the declarations of function parameters explicitly (in the
	  constructor).  It seems that the declaration associated with a
	  function parameter is the function declaration (rather than a 
	  constructed variable declaration, not sure that is the way it
	  should be but I have preserved the behavior.  set_parent is now
	  not called anywhere within the construction of the Sage III AST
	  but is called within the post processing step of fixing up the
	  parent pointers in the AST Fixup.  

	* Added friend equality operator to Sg_File_Info class to permit 
	  testing of reused definitions of defining declarations
	  operator== ( const Sg_File_Info & X, const Sg_File_Info & Y );
	  We need to make sure that as definitions are reused between
	  non-defining and defining declarations that we get the
	  position correct for definitions that are associated with
	  declarations. Even though a definition is built when a
	  non-defining declaration is seen, it is reused (shared) in
	  all declarations and when (and if) finally defined it should have
	  the position of the defining declaration.  This is now tested.

	* Changed several member functions to be const (after change):
	      char* Sg_File_Info::get_filename() const;
	      int Sg_File_Info::get_line() const;
	      int Sg_File_Info::get_col() const;


	* Changed EnumDeclaration::post_construction_initialization()
	  to set the type only if the value of p_type was NULL. It
	  previously rebuilt it's type internally independent of what
	  was passed in as a constructor parameter.

	* Changed ClassDeclaration::post_construction_initialization()
	  to not change the type that it was given.  Previously and type
	  handed in through the constructor parameter list was modified.
	  This had the effect of causing types to use the defining
	  declaration at times (since the unparsing of types is now the
	  unparser at times unparsed class declaration if they are defined
	  through a type (e.g. typedef struct {} X;).  The handling in the 
	  post_construction_initialization() function did not work with
	  the new concept of definind and non-defining declarations.

	* Noticed that SgClassDefinition::post_construction_initialization()
	  and SgTemplateInstantiationDefn::post_construction_initialization()
	  modified the declaration, modified code to output message:
	  "Side-Effect Warning: declaration->set_definition(this) being called from $CLASSNAME::post_construction_initialization()"
	  whenever this happens.  This appears to the the only remaining
	  side-effect on constructors on their input parameters.  Analysis
	  would be helpful here!  The one one was removed (see note above).


	* Noted other side-effect from: 
	       SgEnumDeclaration::insert_enumerator()
	       SgVariableDeclaration::insert_variable()
	  (noted in code and output "Side-Effect Warning").
	  I think that these side-effects to input parameters should be 
	  removed.  But I don't want to break too much for now so 
	  a warning is all they output and we can discuss this in more
	  detail (after Kull compiles).
	

	* Marked all side-effects of input parameters in Sage III.
	  We have tracked down and noted all locations where a Sage III
	  member function modifies its input parameters. The locations
	  where this happens are marked with a print statement which
	  this macro permits us to turn off when we want to either make
	  an intermediate release of just not see the warning messages.
	  Many side-effects have been removed and some are  pending more
	  details discussions internally.  I would like to goal to be a
	  simple rule that input parameters to constructors are not
	  modified by the constructor or any function called within the
	  constructor body.  A stronger rule would be that the input
	  parameters to any access function which gets and data member
	  of sets a data member would not modified its input
	  parameters. Same idea but applied to all access functions, not
	  just constructors.  It is not clear if we need go
	  further. Clearly it might be important to have some function
	  that modify their input parameters but a simple design would
	  disallow it!
	         #define PRINT_SIDE_EFFECT_WARNINGS 0

	* Rewrote unparse functions for class type and enum type.
	  Previous implementions had implemented an older handling of 
	  defining vs. non defining declarations (knowing when to unparse 
	  the declaration's definition).  Such information is now explicit 
	  in the AST (though it can not be represented through isForward()
	  in the declaration because the types reference the declarations
	  and all the types are SHARED!).  So variable declarations and
	  typedef declarations which contain defining declarations are
	  marked explicitly so that the definition can be unparsed in the
	  same statement where it appeared in the ouriginal source code.
	  The unparse functions for class and enum types are now much
	  simpler as a result of not even trying to figure out when to 
	  unparse the associated definitions of enums and classes.

	* Forward references to enum declarations are not allowed by the 
	  C and C++ standards.  They are a common C and C++ extension
	  within many compilers, including EDG, but not g++.  They are 
	  not implemented in the EDG/Sage III interface so they are
	  ignored within ROSE, at present.  The location where they should
	  be added if we want to support them in the future is in the
	  enum case of the switch statement in sage_gen_tag_reference().
	  Currently in this case the function returns a NULL pointer and
	  so it could be justified to implement this case so that at least
	  redeclaration of enum types would be supported (they are allowed
	  in the C and C++ standard, though they appear to be meaningless)
	  and we would have cleaner semantics of return values (non NULL
	  pointers) in the future.  Add it to your C and C++ trivia :-).

	* Fixed "limit" header file warnings (mentioned above in work
	  asociated with this checkin). Set values in 
	  rose-g++-headerfilefixup.h to more acurate values that didn't
	  generate warnings.

	* Added back the set_parent functions to the Sage III 
	  StatementListInsertChild() function.  This is required to fix 
	  a bug in the AST string -based rewrite mechanism, it was
	  previously removed as an unwanted side-effect, but is not 
	  judged reasonable.  Basically what you insert will have it's
	  parent modified to represent inclusion into the new AST
	  (not really an unreasonable side-effect of insertion into an
	  AST).  This allowed the rewrite test codes to pass.
	
	* Fixed name qualification of SgConstructorInitializer
	  expressions. Set qualified_name_need flag to true by 
	  default.  EDG didn't appear to recognize that it was 
	  required. See test2004_120.C for example.
	
	* Commented out several tests run by "make check" rule.
	  I'm not happy that I have done this, I would in general not
	  like to disable any tests and instead fix whatever was causing
	  the problem.  But I suspect that since these tests and part of
	  project developed by others i will have to check in the current
	  work as a first step to working with Markus and Qing to figure
	  out what the problem really is.
	     This test code appears to fall into an infinite loop:
	  SKIPPING TEST CODES RUN BY "make check" rule in exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/astProcessingExamples/printLoopInfo directory ...
	     These two tests terminate in an error.
	  SKIPPING TEST CODES RUN BY "make check" rule in projects/arrayOptimization/test directory ...
	  SKIPPING TEST CODES RUN BY "make check" rule in projects/containerParallelizer/test directory ...
	  SKIPPING TEST CODES RUN BY "make check" rule in tests/roseTests/programTransformationTests directory ...

	* Removed processing of the following directories since I could
	  not make them work with the current version (when running
	  "distcheck" rule).  I don't like that I did this, but I 
	  suspect that I need to work with other developers to help
	  fix the problem and this requires that i checkin the current 
	  work.
	  The directories that I had problems with were:
	       src/3rdPartyLibraries/checkPointLibrary/Makefile
	       src/midend/programAnalysis/annotationLanguageParser/Makefile
	       src/midend/programAnalysis/sideEffectAnalysis/Makefile
	       tests/roseTests/programAnalysisTests/Makefile
	       tests/roseTests/programAnalysisTests/sideEffectAnalysisTests/Makefile

2004-09-08 Markus Schordan 0.7.9c

	* updated documentation
	- added AstAttributeMechanism and AstAttribute to Module Ast Processing.
	- added documentation to AstAttributeMechanism
	- updated documentation of accessing AstAttribute in user manual
	- updated documentation of accessing AstAttribute in example 
	  'printLoopInfo'
	- added class Ast to module AstProcessing
	
	* added a first version of Ast::iterator (forward iterator) 
	  it allows iterating on the AST by using the STL iterator
	  pattern. Nodes are visited in pre-order, encountered null
	  pointers are *not* returned.
	  (This class was available but not finished nor tested. This is
	  still work in progress, only use the public interface!)

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********

	
2004-7-22 Dan Quinlan 0.7.7a
	
	* Fixed ROSE to compile in the source tree (in case anyone wants
	  to do that).  Fix consited to two parts. One suggested by
	  Jeremiah (suggested the fix to ROSE/docs/Rose/Makefile.am). And
	  the other required getting configure script to compute the
	  source tree location correctly and fixing up the substitution
	  in the ROSE/config/support-doxygen.m4 macro.

	* Fixed use of relative path with configure script (used to 
	  result in an error when the documentation was built) The 
	  computation of the correct source tree location also
	  now permits the configure script to be called using a relative
	  path. Previously the configure script had been required to be
	  called using an absolute path (so that the doxygen required 
	  paths could be generated properly).

	* Fixed uninitialized variables in SgFile::initialization() 
	  function. Caused bug in use of -o option on translator command 
	  line.

	* Fixed ROSE so that "make distcheck" works now.  Previously only
	  "gmake distcheck" worked (never undertood why and I don't know
	  just what I fixed to make to all work in a sane way now). 
	  "make dist" also works, but I think that that always worked.

	* Fixed the EDG/Sage connection code to correctly include a valid 
	  declaration pointer to the SgTypedefStatment constructor (where
	  one is available). This was previously a NULL pointer (at least
	  as I understand it).  As a result of this fix, because the
	  declaration pointer is no longer NULL, the code to traverse
	  the declaration in the SgTypedefStatement is not traversed,
	  which results in a cycle in the traversal.  So I have change the
	  specification of the traversal (in the statement.C file) from
	  DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL.  The result is the same since the
	  value of the declaration in the SgTypedefStatement was
	  previously NULL (I believe it was always NULL).  The following
	  code demonstrated the error:
	  "typedef struct Atag4 { typedef Atag4 Btag; } A4;".
	  This does not really fix the problem, I think that it is just 
	  that we have the valid pointer in the AST finally.  The
	  traversal still has to be fixed to permit the traversal of the
	  declaration, but that traversal will depend on if it has been
	  previously traversed, and we don't use visit flags any more to
	  make that trivial (the visit flags caused other problems so we
	  are happy to be clear of them, so to speak). It is not clear
	  how to fixup the traversal to visit the islands, but since they
	  were not previously traversed that bug remains.  

	* The traversal of types is now fairly far along, but incomplete.
	  The appraoch worked out with Markus, is that I will implement
	  a traversal using nested traversals to traverse all types (and
	  islands of cod not previously visited, which is really just the
	  traversal of the definition in the SgTypedefStatement and a
	  related location for the only other sort of islands (see
	  proposals directory for details on the island problem).
	  I have added the query on types to the AstTests.C file, but
	  commented it out so that I can prepare this checkin.  This
	  work will be continued in the next release.

	* Switched to use of shared libraries withn ROSE/src.  ROSE
	  currently has so many directories and due to the way automake
	  works each directory has it's own library.  There are still librose.so
	  and libedg.so libraries in the top level ROSE/src directory.
	  But the building of the librose.so and libedg.so libraries
	  is so time consuming to build, even though they speed up the 
	  linking process.  A more efficient development process 
	  (mostly effective for ROSE developers) is provided which 
	  permits the use of the *.so libraries build in each of the
	  31 ROSE libraries (each its own subdirectory within ROSE/src).
	  If installed, all the libraries are put into the libs directory.
	  The fastest link process is to use the libraries separately, but
	  it is not significantly slower to just link to -lrose and -ledg
	  (as long as it is done dynamically).  The quickest development
	  environment is to use the separate dynamic libraries and just
	  compile the ROSE subdirectory where the code has been modified.
	  This development environment is so fast and comfortable that 
	  it has lead to a switch to dynamic libraries through out ROSE.
	  Each directory now builds its own shared library (same thing as
	  a dynamic library) instead of a static library.  This only
	  effects ROSE developers in general, but user who previously
	  use the static libraries should switch to using dynamic
	  libraries to enjoy a quicker link time and to generate
	  significantly smaller executables.

	* Cleaned up all Makefile.am files to make there handling
	  consistant.

	* Added a few more FAQ questions and at least a few answers.

	* Reorganized and updated the GettingStarted chapter of the ROSE
	  documentation.

	* Fixed
	    ROSE/exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/simpleTranslatorExamples/AstTraversalTranslator.C
	  as suggested by Alin.

	* Fixed up other examples in
	    ROSE/exampleTranslators/documentedExamples/simpleTranslatorExamples
	  to be more current with suggested use of ROSE (more modern
	  interface).

	* Updated ROSE/scripts/configure_with_SQL to show how to configure
	  ROSE to use SQL.
	 
	* Commented out test in ROSE/tests/roseTests/programAnalysisTests.
	  Need to work with Qing to see what the problem is here.

	* Commented out follwoing line in
	    ROSE/src/midend/programAnalysis/CFG/Makefile.am
	  which causes make distcheck to fail.  Need to check with Qing
	  about this problem.
	       # DQ (7/23/2004): Can't find this file anywhere???
	       # EXTRA_DIST = cfgtestfile.c
	

	* Fixed src/roseSupport/templateSupport.C where several asserts
	  prevented the correct execution of a translator when executed
	  with empty commandline (no commandline arguments, trival case).
	  Behavior no matches most compilers, includeing g++.

	* Added support for "*.cpp" suffix as alternative to "*.C".
	  Still need to support "*.cc".
	 
	* Added Jeremiah Willcock's modification to skip renaming of
	  global variables in the inliner.

	. Rewritten the unparsing of paratheses in expressions to
          remove the many redundant paratheses.
        . In ROSETTA/src, fixed bug so that symbol tables are
          never copied (neither deep nor shallow copied) in all cases.
        . Fixed include-file directives with relative directories in
          many cases in programAnalysis and loopProcessing.
        . Added test files for programAnalysis.
        . Fixed mod-read information for incremental statments such as
          SgPlusPlus/MinusMinus, etc.

2004-7-10 Dan Quinlan 0.7.6a

	* Added Jeremiah Willcock's inlining support.  Located in:
	  ROSE/src/midend/astInlining and ROSE/tests/roseTests/astInliningTests.
	  Includes a translator for testing inlining on arbitrary input
	  codes, inliner test code inlines all possible functions and
	  cleans up code to present better code to backend (vendor) compiler.
	  This has been checked in early so that we may all play with it
	  and test it before Jeremiah leaves at the end of summer.
	  This work in an important part of enabling more complex optimizations.

	* Added support for dynamic libraries

	* Added support for a single rose and single EDG library.  This
	  sets us up to later provide the EDG library as a binary in a
	  future (so that we can distribute ROSE on the web without the 
	  EDG source code (permitted under there license to support research.
	  Example of how to build ROSE executable (with static and dynamic
	  linking):
	     g++  -fPIC -g -Wall   -o testStaticRoseLib  testRoseLib.o librose.a libedg.a -lm -lfl 
             g++  -fPIC -g -Wall   -o testSharedRoseLib  testRoseLib.o -L<path> librose.so libedg.so -lm -lfl 
	  The -L<path> is set at configure time (no action by the user is
	  required).
	
	* Added suport for -rpath (using Brian Gunney's autoconf macros),
	  Rpath syntax is set on the configure command line or defaults 
	  are set internally if it is not specified (see configure --help).

	* Fixed up all Makefile.am to build executables using dynamic
	  libraries (linking is much faster with dynamic linking and
	  the executables are dramatically smaller (typically 0.5% of
	  original size).

	* Removed all uses of sage_bool, sage_false, and sage_true (which
	  predated the introduction of bool within C++).  Suggested by
	  Jeremiah Willcock.

	* Replaces uses of "Boolean" with "bool", fixed several places
	  where "int" and "bool" were mixed up in the code. Removed
	  "FALSE" (replaced with "false") and "TRUE" (replaced with "true").

	* Added test to show how to add comments to AST (test requires a
	  comment to be associated with a valid statement (demonstrating
	  current bug).  This will be fixed in a future checkin.

	* Moved source code and header files (all but rose.h and
	  roseInternal.h) from ROSE/src to ROSE/src/roseSupport.

	* Fixed new directories to work with make -j4.

	* Removed use of Brian Miller's Performance Tests Suits since it
	  appears to have been removed from the his CVS repository.

	* Added support from C++ files with cpp suffix (fix copied from
	  Andreas's fix following his instructions).

	* Added some questions to the ROSE FAQ (with answers).

	* Removed ROSE/roseLibs, this was the previous home to a test to
	  build ROSE as two libraries.  This work took a while to mature
	  and has resulted in the new dynamic library support in ROSE.
	  (This work is checked in within this current internal release.)
	  Support is provided for two libraries -lrose and -ledg. This 
	  work has been moved to the ROSE/src directory now that all ROSE
	  source code is contained in ROSE/src.

	* Fixed attachPreprocessingInfo.C and rose_attributes_list.[hC]
	  to improve implementation of these classes (member data is
	  now private, access functions are provided, PreprocessingInfo
	  objects are now moved from the list, where it is built using the
	  lex pass, to the AST without marking the state internally.
	  Internal state is not changed as a result of insertion into AST.

	* Added test for the function in a function call to be a valid 
	  function type. Commented out until after checkin so that it
	  can be fixed in the next release.

	* Fixed (with Qing) several multiplly defined symbols that that
	  became clear in the construction of the librose.so shared library.

	* Fixed ROSE/scripts/cvschk to filter Makefile.in files from the
	  list of "Extra Files".  There are so many directories and
	  Makefile.in files that they tend to obscure the important
	  entries that are a part of basic error checking prior to a CVS 
	  checkin.

	* Removed ROSE/projects/Makefile.in from CVS repository (should
	  not have been added).

	* Added GNU attribute (depricated) to SgProject old constructor.
	  This uses the new GNU attribute mechanism and provides a warning
	  at compile-time when this depricated function is used.  Future
	  use of the depricated attribute will permit a shift from old 
	  parts of the Sage III interface.

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********
	
	
2004-7-7 Dan Quinlan 0.7.5a
	* Fixed bug reported by Beata.  This was the last bug to be fixed
	  in the list previously addressed in the AST fixup (except for
	  the resetting of the parent pointers to match the traversal).
	  All tests in the AST fixup are now asserts so that they will
	  be properly trapped if found in the future.

	* This version reorganized the ROSE directory structure, as agreed
	  upon in December 2003 and as proposed in ROSE/proposals.
	  Minor differences still exists:
	     1) not all names are uniformly following the same 
	        conventions, but most all and all new directories do so.
	        Only a few lower level directories violate this rule.
	     2) All tests using ROSE (using any code in ROSE/src) had
	        to be moved outside of ROSE/src so that the libraries 
	        could all be built before attempting to link test codes.
	        All test have been moved to the ROSE/tests/roseTests
	        directory.
	  A circular dependence regarding the Coco work is documented
	  but not yet fixed.  I expect that Markus should comment on that
	  and maybe even fix it up as he thinks best.  The following
	  message in the Makefiles document the problem:
	     # Dependence cycle found in makefiles: ROSE/src/3rdPartyLibraries/coco can't be built until
             # ROSE is built and ROSE/midend/astProcessing/CocoPreprocessor can't be built until
             # coco is built.  ROSE can't be built until all of ROSE/src (including it's subdirectories)
             # is built.  Not clear now to best fix this Coco problem.

	* Much of the documentation has been iterated over and new
	  sections have been added based on user (and student) feedback.
	  
	* Corrections and typos in the manual kindly contributed by Beata last
	  year were finally used. So at least all those problems are fixed. We
	  welcome contributions and comments from anyone else regarding
	  the documentation in ROSE.  Eventually it is used to improve the 
	  documentation :-).

	* New version of ROSE using new directory structure work using
	  "make -j4", previouslt failed. "make -j4 check" and 
	  "gmake -j4 distcheck" now work as well.

********* ERRORS *********

	
2004-5-30 Dan Quinlan 0.7.4a
	* Added template handling support to ROSE
	      * New IR nodes for representation of templates in AST
	      * Support for "prelinking" template instantiation
	      * Suppport for transformations on instantiated templates
	      * Support for unparsing templates
	      * Support for unparsing the instantiations (classes and
	        functions)
	* Added support in node query mechanism to permit query on variant
	      * Permits extraction of any variant or combination of
	        variants from the AST.
	      * Permits specification of subtrees (in hierarchy) of IR
	        nodes (e.g. SgDeclarationStatement, SgBinaryOp, etc.)
	      * Permits digging out types in traversed nodes (QueryDepth)
	             * QueryDepth can be specified to be: ChildrenOnly,
	               AllNodes (all traversed nodes), and ExtractTypes
	               (digs types out of traversed IR nodes).
	* Added commandline handling (packaged for use by user and
	  internally in ROSE). Located in:
	     ROSE/util/commandline_processing.[h,C]
	* moved lower level commandline handling SLA files to
	  ROSE/util directory.
	* Added documentation to outline how to add IR nodes.
	* Added documentation on how to add custom commandline processing.
	* Added commandline support to permit passing edg options through
	  to the edg frontend:
	     --edg:xxx               passes --xxx     to the edg frontend
	     -edg:xxx                passes -xxx      to the edg frontend
	     --edg_parameter:xxx abc passes --xxx abc to the edg frontend
	     --edg_parameter:xxx n   passes --xxx  n  to the edg frontend
	  For full range of EDG options consult EDG documentation (section
	  2.1).  Even complex options may be passed: 
	       --edg_parameter:define_macro XYZ,ABC,DEF=3! 
	  However, now that al this works, it is clear that many EDG
	  options do not appear to work properly.  Have not attempted
	  debugging EDG directly to get more info on this.
	* Added support for Old-style C function definitions (which is 
	  part of the ANSI standard for C (even in the c99 standard!)).
	  Old-style C function definitions seem to be the only thing 
	  missing to compile older K&R C applications.
	* Added support in EDG/SAGE III connection for UPC
	* Added support in SAGE III SgModifierType for shared, strict, and
	  relaxed.
	* corrected spelling of SgTemplateInstantiationSymboSym to 
	  SgTemplateInstantiationSymbolSym.
	* Fixed generation of Cxx_GrammarCocoSymbolsMapping.C to not
	  truncate names (fixed grammar.C Grammar::cocoScannerDefineName()).
	  Added comment and date to make the change clear.
	* Added documentation to appendix.tex to explain how tempplates
	  are handled in ROSE.
	* Turned on export keyword support in EDG for templates.
	* Turned on exception handling support in EDG.
	* Added Beata's tip to remote use of CVS repository to ROSE/README
	  file.
	* Redesigned how modifiers (specifiers) used, implemented and accessed.
	* Added support for "mutable" keyword
	* Added support for "register" keyword (bug reported by Chadd).
	* Added support for "restrict" keyword.
	    Use of "restrict" requires --edg:restrict command line option.
	* Added support for "export" keyword for templates (a bug in EDG
	    does not mark exported template member functions properly, so
	    this is a current limitation (though g++ does not support the 
	    "export" keyword at all (it give a warning and ignores it)).
	    Use of "export" requires --edg:export command line option.
	* Fixed bugs required to parse STL application (using list class)
	* Fixed handling of "()" in calls to compiler-generated vs. user
	    supplied default constructors (see test2001_06.C).
	* Fixed handling of g++ command line generation when using "-e"
	  options (previous template support for prelinking broke this).
	* Added test codes that had accumulated in my development
	  directory into the ROSE/TESTS/CompileTests/C++Code directory.
	* Removed option to use older EDG version 1.4 C++ frontend
	  (default was previously EDG version 3.3, this is now the only
	  version of EDG supported).  Newer versions of EDG can be easily
	  supported as they become available.
	* Added current state of several proposals for modifications to
	  ROSE (in ROSE/proposals directory).
	* Fixed ROSE/ProgramAnalysis/CFG/Makefile.am to use parallel make
	  (notes in file specify details of what was wrong and what was
	    fixed).
	* Commented out LoopProcessing/test testcode since diff obtained
	    incorrect match (check details with Qing).
	* Lots of other bugs fixed as well, too many go into detail about
	  (represented by test code test2004_18.C - test2004_45.C).

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********



	
2004-4-29 Qing Yi 0.7.3a
	* Added util/graphs and util/support directories, which were moved from
	  the LoopProcessing directory. Also added midend/astUtil/ directory,
	  which contains astInterface, astSupport, and symbolicVal directories,
	  moved from the original LoopProcessing and ProgramAnalysis 
	  directories; and annotation subdirectory, which is new. 
	  The astUtil directory contains AST related facilities
	  that can be used by higher-level AST processing codes, such as
	  the LoopProcessing and ProgramAnalysis implementations.
	* Added Projects/arrayOptimization directory, which contains code that
	  applies optimizations to array containers with semantics similar
	  to the A++ library.  Optimizations include both loop transformations
	  in LoopProcessing directory and further rewriting of collective 
	  array operators into lower-level explicit loop implementations.
	* Added ProgramAnalysis/dataflowAnalysis directory, which contains
	  code implementing classic iterative data flow analysis algorithms.
	  implemented reaching definition analysis and def-use chain.
	* Added ProgramAnalysis/valuePropagation directory, which uses both
	  annotations and def-use chain analysis to propagate annotated 
	  property values of class objects. Used in arrayOptimization.
	* LoopProcessing:
	   - rearranged directory structure: moved graphs and support
	     directories to ROSE/util; removed outsideInterface directory, 
	     moved LoopTransformInterface.h/C into LoopProcessing root;
	     moved AstInterface.h/C into midend/astUtil/astInterface;
	     split original BlockingAnal.h into .h and .C; moved original
	     BreakupStatement.h/C into the new TransformAstTree.h/C in the
	     "driver" subdirectory;
	   - Improved dependence analysis to handle some cases of linearized
	     arrays. Added loop unrolling. Changed profitability of blocking
	     analysis to consider spatial reuses in addition to temporal ones.
	* ContainerParallelizer/CPAnalysis:
	  - Removed the old UserSpec.h to use the new annotation facilities
	    in midend/astUtil/annotation
	* ROSETTA/Grammar/LocatedNode.code: changed interface for
	  "AttachedPreprocessingInfoType* getAttachedPreprocessingInfo(void);"
	  to become 
	  "AttachedPreprocessingInfoType*& getAttachedPreprocessingInfo(void)",
	  thereby allowing attached preprocessing info. to be copied in
	  the SgNode::copy implementation.
	* ROSETTA/Grammar/Node.code: commented out "assert (parent != NULL);"
	  in SgNode::set_parent, because we should allow setting parent to 
	  NULL when detaching AST subtrees, eg., when replacing one tree with
	  another.
	* ROSETTA/src/grammarString.C: fixed line 39 in implementing 
	  SgNode::copy so that a pointer is checked whether it's NULL before 
	  accessing the destiniation.
	* src/unparser/unparse_format.C: fixed the mixups in calling 
	  SgNode::variantT() vs. SgNode::variant(), an old mixup made when
	  I didn't know the difference yet.

2004-2-9 Dan Quinlan 0.7.2a
	* RECORD_TEMPLATES_IN_IL renamed to RECORD_TEMPLATE_STRINGS in
	  sage specific EDG/SAGE connection.
	* Fixed memory problems found with valgrind
	* Verified that EDG AST is still available so that Andreas's
	  data structure traversal mechanism can provide a display of both
	  the EDG and SAGE III ASTs from within a ROSE translator.
	* EXTRA_SOURCE_POSITIONS_IN_IL is an option in EDG 3.3 and has
	  been turned on and the extra information used so that the
	  source code position of expressions is now accurately recorded
	  in EDG and finally in SAGE III (useful for SvPablo).
	* Fixed use of #pragma (bug report from Andreas)
	* Repositioned SgPragmaStatement to be derived from SgDeclaration.
	* Fixed use of #pragma in scopes containing only declarations
	  (global scope, class definition scope, etc.).
	* Renamed SgPragmaStatement --> SgPragmaDeclaration
	* Removed Comment and CPP directive IR nodes from SAGE
	  (these were never used).
	* Runs cleanly through valgrind (except for memory leaks!)
	* Characterised what code generates islands of non-traversed AST:
	    class  tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	    struct tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	    union  tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	  And the same types hidden in a typedef type ...
	    typedef class  tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	    typedef struct tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	    typedef union  tag { int declaration_not_visited; } X;
	  Details in ROSE/proposals/islandsOfUntraversedAST.txt.
	* fixed unparser to handle "typedef class tag { int x; } X;"
	  (keyword "class" was not previously output).
	* Fixed AST rewrite mechanism to permit use of StatementScope
	  (allowing direct insertion into scopes, missing previously).
	  Previously you had to be at a statement in the scope to insert
	  a statement into the same scope.  The current addition permits
	  a more intuative use of the insert mechanism within AST
	  rewrites.
	* Added Andreas' data structure processing work.  Though at the
	  moment it had to be commented out in the Makefile.am since it
	  caused a circular dependence in the Makefile system for ROSE.
	  The fix will be to move the AST_RewriteMechanism directory into
	  the ROSE/src directory (part of the original directory
	  reorganization) so the the dependence can be resolved in the
	  ordering of the directories in the ROSE/src/Makefile.am.  A
	  zero-fun nonsense detail that will be most likely fixed in 
	  the next release of ROSE (only a problem for the 
	  "gmake distcheck" rule, ...).
	* Added ROSE/proposals directory (part of new proposed directory
	  structure).  This directory is a place to collect documents
	  supporting future modifications to ROSE (new required features,
	  suggested changes, etc.).  Some documentation starts here and
	  is later moved into the more official documentation when it is
	  ready, sometimes even before it is ready :-).
	* Added test codes: test2004_09.C - test2004_17.C representing
	  some of the bugs fixed were fixed.
	* Fixed 2 bugs reported by Chadd (more difficult bug in in
	  test2004_13.C).
	* Using g++ -Wall -Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default, fixed and
	  verified all switch statements in EDG/SAGE connection code
	  identify all cases (to prevent and detect new cases specific 
	  to EDG 3.3 from being used unexpectedly.  This caught many
	  subtle errors related to new IR nodes in EDG which the older
	  EDG/SAGE code was not aware of.  The Makefile.am in 
	  ROSE/src/frontend/EDG_SAGE_Connection details the use of
	  specialized options.  Complete listing can be found by using:
	  g++ -v --help (lots of specialized warnings to turn on to
	  support code maintance/development).
	* Added vararg support into AST (new SAGE III IR nodes)

2004-1-20 Dan Quinlan 0.7.1a
	* Fixed infinite loop in EDG/SAGE connection caused when
	  processing some simple typedef statements (long standing bug).
	* Fixed AST Rewrite Mechanism to allow midlevel rewrite mechanism
	  to insert statements (from strings) into SgScopeStatements.
	  Previously we only supported top of scope, before, replace,
	  after, bottom of scope; but not into a statement which was a
	  scope.  This has been changed to permit the insertion of
	  statements into the top and bottom of the targeted scope
	  statement (not just the scope of the target scope statement).
	  The scope must now specificed explicitly for the midlevel insert
	  function.  "LocalScope" has been renamed "SurroundingScope" and
	  the scope of the target statement (if it is a SgScopeStatement
	  is named "StatementScope").
	* Better error reporting has been implemented for where the 
	  insert function can be applied (with suggested work arounds
	  reported).
	* A new function: 
	  bool
	    MidLevelRewrite<MidLevelInterfaceNodeCollection>::insertSupported 
	        ( SgStatement* astNode, 
	          MidLevelCollectionTypedefs::ScopeIdentifierEnum inputRelativeScope );
	  This function returns true if the IR node is supported as a
	  target for insert. There are a few nodes that are currently not
	  supported by insert (see below).

	  Notes (put into documentation):
	  There are several types of statements which the AST rewrite mechanism can not 
	  currently process.  Below we enumerate these and examplain why each is difficult 
	  or not currently possible.
	       1) Why we have to skip SgCaseOptionStmt statements.
	               Example of code in generated intermedate file for a SgCaseOptionStmt:
	               int GlobalScopePreambleStart;
	               int GlobalScopePreambleEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationTopOfScopeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationTopOfScopeEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationBeforeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationBeforeEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationReplaceStart;
	               case 0:{y++;break;}
	               int CurrentLocationReplaceEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationAfterStart;
	               int CurrentLocationAfterEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationBottomOfScopeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationBottomOfScopeEnd;
	          The problem is that marker declaration that appear after the SgCaseOptionStmt 
	          are included in the scope of the SgCaseOptionStmt while those that appear 
	          before it are not in the same scope.

	       2) SgDefaultOptionStmt (see reason #1 above).
	       3) SgCtorInitializerList
	          This case would have to generate special handling to be generated in the 
	          intermediate file and likely it would require special handling isolated 
	          from the AST.  Likely this case can be handled in the future with extra work.
	       4) SgFunctionParameterList (see reason #3 above).
	       5) SgClassDefinition
	          Since the SgClassDefinition is so structurally tied to the SgClassDeclaration 
	          it make more sense to process the SgClassDeclaration associated with the 
	          SgClassDefinition instead of the SgClassDefinition directly.  Presently the 
	          processing of the SgClassDefinition is not supported through any indirect 
	          processing of the SgClassDeclaration, this could be implemented in the future.
	       6) SgGlobal
	          This case is not implemented, it would require special handling, it might be 
	          implemented in the future.
	       7) SgBasicBlock used in a SgForStatement
	          Because of the declaration of the for loop index variable, this case would 
	          require special handling. This case could be implemented in the future.
	       8) SgBasicBlock used in a SgFunctionDefinition
	          Because of the declaration of the function parameter variable, this case would 
	          require special handling. This case could be implemented in the future.
	       9) SgBasicBlock used in a SgSwitchStatement
	          Example of code in generated intermedate file for a SgBasicBlock used in 
	          SgSwitchStatement:
	               int main()
	               { /* local stack #0 */
	               int x;
	               int y;
	               switch(x)
	               { /* local stack #1 */ 
	               int GlobalScopePreambleStart;
	               int GlobalScopePreambleEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationTopOfScopeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationTopOfScopeEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationBeforeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationBeforeEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationReplaceStart;
	               {case 0:{y++;break;}default:{y++;break;}}
	               int CurrentLocationReplaceEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationAfterStart;
	               int CurrentLocationAfterEnd;
	               int CurrentLocationBottomOfScopeStart;
	               int CurrentLocationBottomOfScopeEnd;
	               /* Reference marker variables to avoid compiler warnings */
	                  };     };
	          This is more difficult because the declaration markers must appear after 
	          the "{ /* local stack #1 */" but then the statement "{case 0:{y++;break;}default:{y++;break;}}"
	          cannot appear after a switch.  Likely it is not possible to fix this case due to the
	          design and constraints of the C++ language (design and limitations of the switch statement).
	          This is not a serious problem, it just means that the whole switch statement must
	          be operated upon instead of the block within the switch statement separately.
	* Added new tests codes and fixed bugs (test2004_0[4-8]) relating
	  to cycles found in the AST.
	* Fixed handling of redundent typedefs in the EDG/SAGE interface.
	  Legal in C++, but I think not legal in C(?).
	* Made EDG 3.3 the default. Removed --with-EDG_3.3 configure option
	  and made a --with-EDG_1.4 option to permit use of older version
	  of EDG (until it is removed).  Future fixes will only be done to
	  to the latest version of EDG and not EDG version 1.4.
	* Added new test codes (test2004_03-08).

2004-1-09 Dan Quinlan 0.7.0a
	* Updated EDG frontend from version 1.4 to 3.3.  This absorbs ten
	  years of work on C++ and ten years of work on the EDG front-end
	  by the EDG guys (to whom we are very thankful).  This also
	  sets the stage for addressing robustness issues in C++
	  (templates, namespaces, etc.).  Use --with-EDG_3_3 on configure
	  command line to use new version.  Previous version is the
	  current default (will be changed after later).
	* The connection of EDG to SAGE III has been resigned and is 
	  separated into a separate directory.  this design leaves the EDG
	  code nearly in tact (except for some small changes which SAGE 
	  requires. All changes are marked in the code ("DQ (date): comment").
        * The SAGE/EDG connection code now compiler with g++ 3.3.2 without 
	  warnings (using -Wall, which turns on all warnings).  Many
	  subtle bugs were fixed by carefully fixing all the warnings!
	* Some progress made toward new directory structure.  New
	  directories added in locations consistant with new directory
	  structure design. All EDG directories moved to ROSE/src/frontend/EDG.
	  More work to actually move existing directories will be 
	  done as part of a special checking to JUST redo the directory 
	  ROSE structure (later).
	* ROSE/src/rose.C was moved and renamed ROSE/TESTS/testTranslator.C
	  It was only used for tests, so it was put into the TESTS
	  directory; and the dependences of executable on libraries
	  didn't permit any executables (which required all libraries) to
	  be build in the ROSE/src directory. Updates from Markus were handled.
	* Fixed Makefile.am files in ROSE/TESTS subdirectories to call 
	  new ROSE/TESTS/testTranslator instead of RSE/src/rose.
	* Use of GNU g++ 3.x compiler determined at configure time and
	  use of gnu headers triggered automatically.  So
	  --with-GNU_HEADERS configure optin is no longer required when
	  using gnu g++ 3.x compilers.  Use of gnu g++ 2.96 will use the
	  constructed setof header files.  Other compiler will use there
	  own constructed set of header files as well.  
	* Prefix generation now assumes a normalized AAST in the sense
	  that member function are declared in their class and need not be
	  redundently declared outside of there class (which is not
	  legal C++ code).  Prefix generation now detects member function
	  declarations in global scope and skips them.
	* Removed calls to algo.h in multiple files of the
	  AST_RewriteMechanism directory.
	* Added functions to display parts of the EDG AST (debugging.C).
	* Cleaned up (removed dead code) from parts of EDG and
	  EDG_SAGE_Connection.
	* Fixed bug in sidlFunction.C which happens only with new version
	  of EDG (due to the normalized AST).
	* Updated some database files before Nils left (12/19/2003).
	* Fixed g++ warnings in ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar code files.
	* Made several of ROSETTA functionsuse strings (start of
	  conversion from char* to string useage within ROSETTA.
	* Fixed usage of system header files to correct select
	  between <name.h> and <name> for header files.
	* Cleaned up code which g++ -Wall complained about through out
	  ROSE.
	* Added output of mysql requirements to SCRIPTS/cvschk.
	* Updated documentation on Design of ROSE within ROSE manual.
	  (Suggested/Inspired by Bjarne).
	* Added test code to ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory directory.
	* Modified rewrite mechanism to name intermediate files using the
	  original source file name plus and unique number for each
	  iteration. This permits use of make -j in testing.
	* Fixed use of algo.h in ROSE/util/string_functions.C

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********


2003-12-19 Markus Schordan 0.6.8a
	* deactivated the use of a visit flag in the traversal.
	* eliminated all cycles in the AST traversal (which occur 
	  without visit flag)
        * added cycle test to AstTests (class AstCycleTest)
	* added option -I<PATH> to cpp2ps to allow an include path.
	* added function 'generate' to AstDOTGeneration to generate dotoutput
	  for the whole AST (input file and include files).

	* fixed LoopProcessing/AstInterface.C because it was using the
	  SAGE interface to modify the AST which introduces a cycle.
	  Cycles cause infinite recursions of the traversal.

	  The following fix was applied:
	  // to fix everything except parent pointers
          #include "AstTraversal.h"
          #include "AstFixes.h"
          ...
	  // perform AST fixes on an AST (which was not created by
	     using the rewrite system, e.g. by using the SAGE interface only)
          subTemporaryAstFixes(node);
          // perform cycle test to make sure no cycle exists
	  // If a cycle is found it is printed. (can be used for testing)
          AstCycleTest cycTest;
          cycTest.traverse(r);

	* fixed ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/DataStructurePreprocessor because
	  it was traversing an AST subtree in a type which is not fixed
	  by the AstFixes.C

      	* added OmpPragmaParser yacc-grammar 
	  (not integrated in configuration)

	* Added vector<bool> to replace enum value that used each bit as a
	  flag and needed more flags (bits) than permitted in a long
	  integer (32 bit).  Version 3.x of g++ does not permit long
	  long enum values (only long enum values).  So a vector<bool>
	  was used to in place of the long enum value in the
	  SgUnparse_Info object.
	* Added "using std::xxx" statements to Nil's dotgl visualization
	  code. Comments added in code to identify added statements. 
	  Still can't compile dotgl, likely because FLTK and GraphViz
	  need to be compiled using the 3.x compiler.
	* Fixed numerous errors so that ROSE now runs cleanly with
	  Valgrind.
	* Cleaned up compilation with -Wall (all warnings) with gnu 3.x 
	  compilers for header files generally and within the 
	  AST_RewriteMechanism directory. Compiles with no warnings.

	* Removed CC++ support from SAGE III.  This was the most
	  significant change to EDG made by the original SAGE developers
	  and clears the way for updates to the new vrsion of EDG with
	  minimal changes to EDG directly.  This also fixed a mysterious
	  memory problem that caused unexplainable EDG compiler error
	  messages (when invoking the EDG front-end multiple times as
	  required for the rewrite mechanism).  This problem was
	  difficult to identify because Valgrind would execute to
	  program without error, but without Valgrind we would get the
	  error.
	* This version uses an idea from Markus for a test code for the
	  AST Rewrite Mechanism.  A test code which replaces every
	  statement of the input problem with the unparsed string
	  representing the original statement.  This is a particularly
	  difficult test code and forced a lot of internal work within
	  the rewrite mechanism to handle special cases that occure
	  within C++.  Bugs found using this test were fixed in the
	  AST Rewrite Mechanism.
	* Fixed SgStatement::get_scope() member function (see
	  implementation for comments).
	* Fixed EDG/SAGE connection code so that member declarations only
	  have a valid function definition if they are associated with a
	  member function that is is defined (same as for global
	  functions).  This reduces the requirement for the AST Fixups
	  for member function declarations (I think).  Also the symbols
	  of member functions now point to the correct function
	  declarations as opposed to dummy ones (which are still build for
	  temporary use until the associated function definition is
	  finally seen).  Currently fails with TESTS/CompileTests/A++Code/domain.C
	* Fixed EDG/SAGE interface code to handle cases in switch
	  statements that declare variables but don't have explcit "{}"
	  blocks defined.  This was a problem for code generated within 
	  the rewrite mechanism.
	* Added Nils Thuerey's database (MySQL) connection.
	* Added Nils Thuerey's visualization (dotgl) tool.
	* Added Nils Thuerey's graphics directory (already depricated code
	  in favor of using the Boost graph library) which uses classes 
	  defined in the STL Components book.  
	* Fixed ExamplePreprocessors/BabelPreprocessor/sidlFunction.C
	  to not access the SgFunctionDefinition of a
	  SgMemberFunctionDeclaration since it is not a NULL pointer
	  if the declaration is not associated with the definition.
	* Added member function to add options to graph nodes in 
	  MSTL/DOTGeneration.C.
	* Added assers for tests of pointers returned from new to
	  MSTL/DOTRepresentation.C.
	* Fixed EDG/SAGE interface so that test of
	  SgMemberFunctionDeclaration is no longer required in 
	  SAGE/AstFixes.C.  Modified SAGE/AstFixes.C to make add
	  assertion that the fixup is not required.
	* Fixed unparser to be more strict in unparsing 
	  SgConstructorinitializer (asserts when need_name is 
	  required more strictly than before and forced mods to
	  the EDG/SAGE interface to get the need_name flag set properly.
	  Part of gneral fixes to function and member function declaration
	  handling (above).
	* Added enum value to SgUnparseInfo to permit skipping the basic
	  block when unparsing.  This supports the generation of
	  specialized code supporting the prefix generation for the
	  rewrite mechanism.
	* Had to add long long values to enum (now 64 bit). and had to
	  make the value holding the enums also "long long int".
	* Added enhansed support for prefix generation (no generating the 
	  control structure within the prefix so that "cases" will
	  properly compile within switch statements, and for loops will be
	  declared showing all index declarations.
	* Added support for prefix to be optionally generated starting at
	  the position before the target statement so that if the current
	  statement is a declaration then it can't be included twice if it
	  is added again (replaced with itself, as in test code).
	* Added dotgenLetter to permit dot graphs to be formatted onto a
	  simple page (using -Gsize="7.5,10").
	* Added reference to dependence on .cvsrc file in README
	  we assume use of .cvsrc file specifying "update -P -d" and 
	  "checkout -P" (also in ~dquinlan/.cvsrc).
	* Modified unparser to use SkipBasicBlock() functions to control
	  unparsing of the badies of SgForStmt and SgSwitchStmt as part of
	  support for generating greater context within the prefix (for
	  support of the AST Rewrite Mechanism).
	* Added configure commandline options:
	     --with-MySQL=PATH     Specify the prefix where MySQL & MySQL++ is installed
	     --with-MySQL_server=MACHINE_NAME      Specify the MySQL database server to be used
	     --with-MySQL_username=USER_NAME       Specify the MySQL username to be used
	     --with-MySQL_password=PASSWORD        Specify the MySQL password to be used
	     --with-MySQL_database_name=DATABASE_NAME      Specify the MySQL database name to be used
	     --with-FLTK_include=PATH      Specify the prefix where FLTK include files is installed
	     --with-FLTK_libs=PATH Specify the prefix where FLTK libraries are installed
	     --with-GraphViz_include=PATH  Specify the prefix where GraphViz include files are installed
	     --with-GraphViz_libs=PATH     Specify the prefix where GraphViz libraries are installed

        . Changed ROSE/Analysis directory to ROSE/ProgramAnalysis. Rearranged this directory 
          and added Interface, CFG, OAWrap (OpenAnalysis Wrap) and OpenAnalysis directory.
          OpenAnalysis source files belong to the repository but not build directly using automake.
          Instead, they are wrapped in namespace OpenAnalysis and compiled in OAWrap directory.
        . Added Control flow analysis implementation interface and two implementations,
          one in namespace ROSE_Analysis and one in namespace OpenAnalysis
        . Add Niles's DOTGraph output interface and implementation into MSTL directory
        . Changed EDGE/src/sageSupport.C to generate NULL_FileInfo instead of abort
          when seeing templates.
        . Changed ROSETTA/Grammar/Support.code and SAGE/AstFixes.C to swap the order
          of applying AstFix (AstFix should be applied before invoking AstPreprocessing)
          and to swap the order of applying ResetParent Fix and other fixes
          (Reset-parent-Fix should be the last one so that the tree is consistant after Fix).
        . Changed ROSETTA/src/statement.C to disable the traversal of SgLabelStatement
          within SgGotoStatement. This creates a cycle in the tree traversal. Eventually,
          this should be fixed so that the SgLabelStatement node is not shared between
          the real label and the goto statement, so that proper tree operations, such as
          tree copy,  can proceed correctly.
        . Changed SAGE/attachPreprocessingInfo.C to comment out an assertion that disallows
          the endOfConstruct FileInfo to be NULL, which failed when processing template
          classes. May need further fix.
        . Changed LoopProcessing directory to support ROSE CFG analysis impl.

	* Fixed Cghadd's bug in EDG/SAGE connection for unnamed fields in structs.
	  This was the remaining bug that prevented the use of the gnu 3.x 
	  compilers with the 2.96 header files.  So as a result we can not
	  use the gnu 3.x 3.x compilers with ROSE, and use the gnu 3.x
	  compilers as a backend compiler for ROSE.  A better fix at a
	  later date will be to use the 3.x header files with the 
	  3.x compiler (but this will require the newest version of EDG
	  within ROSE and some additional work on the 3.x header files
	  as required to process them through the newest version of EDG
	  (not too much work, so it should be OK, it might require a
	  hand modified version of the 3.x header fiels, but it is not
	  too much that has to be modified (a few things commented out
	  is all that is required))).
	* Fixed Chadd's other bug that he reported as well (it was the
	  least we could do after his first bug being the one that 
	  when fixed allowed us to use the 3.x compilers finally.
	  "for (int i=0; i <n; i++);" failed to compile. An empty 
	  SgBasicBlock is now generated so that the pointer to the
	  basic blosk is not null (internal processing within ROSE is not
	  quite strict and an empty block is better than a null pointer
	  so that null pointers generally can be interpreted to be errors.
	* Fixed documentation for the --with-GNU_HEADERS configure option
	* Removed the --with-INTEL_HEADERS option (as Markus suggested).
	* Commented out the test codes run in
	  LoopProcessing/tests/Makefile.am. Qing will address these in her
	  next checkin as a final part of the move to work with both gnu
	  2.96 and gnu 3.x compilers.

	* Added ROSE/Projects directory (to be new home for different
	  projects which provide additional features to ROSE. The 
	  Projects directory currently includes subdirectories for:
	    1) DataBase feature within ROSE.  This is the current
	       working version from Nils.  Example codes are not yet
	       using this version and will shortly.
	    2) HighLevelGrammars (automated definition of high grammars
	       for domain-specific languages from libraries; this is the
 	       2nd implementation of this work which previously appeared 
	       within ROSETTA) (current work is still incomplete).
	  The current status of this work is checked in with this release.
	* Draft of desing document for Highlevel grammars within ROSE 
	  (still incomplete).
	* Fixed configureation bug which caused GNU_HEADERS directory to
	  be overwritten by the configuration mechanism's default
	  construction of header files from the  backen compiler.
	* Removed comment generated by Query library.
	* Make setup of backend compiler's heder files a separate macro.
	* Added unparser.h to rose.h
	* Added ROSE/src/unparser/*.h files to the installation include
	  directory (generated by "make install")
	* Added supporting functions to ROSE/src/transformation.[hC]
	  to support getting parent locations in the AST from any AST
	  node.
	* Added made parameters to stripPathFromFileName and
	  getPathFromFileName functions in ROSE/src/utility_functions.[hC]
	  const.
	* Moved function to generate declarations (used in prefix
	  mechanism) to unparser.[hC] so that it could be used more
	  generally (within Projects/HighLevelGrammars).
	* Fixed AST_RewriteMechanism/prefixGeneration.C to use general
	  mechanism now defined in the unparser.
	* Added function to read a string from a file in
	  ROSE/util/string_functions.
	* Fixed generation of mangled names for functions and classes (not
	  used anywhere else, so that should be the complete fix now).

        * KNOWN BUGS: configure option --with-GNU_HEADERS overwrites ROSE default headers.
	  configure cannot be used with 3.3.2 yet.
        * fixed problems in ROSE to compile with gcc3.2
	  added __GNUC__ and __GNUC_MINOR__ where necessary to ensure backward compatibilty to 2.96
          (but note: make (dist)check does *not* succeed with 3.x header files
	   use: configure --
	  - fixed frame files in Coco

2003-10-22 Dan Quinlan 0.6.0a
	* Finished ROSE rewrite mechanism. This version reorganizes
	  previous work and added multiple levels of interfaces to
	  partition and organize how the rewrite mechanism is seen and
	  used. Four levels of interface are defined and the best place
	  to find out more information is in the documentation.
	* Features added to rewrite mechanism to support transformation 
	  specification of complex strings and line continuation characters.
	* Features added to rewrite mechanism to handle macros and control
	  how they are expanded (prevent them from being expanded
	  prematurely in the intermediat code so that they can be
	  preserved in the final unparsed code. These are used in the
	  varargs processing as well.
	* Documentation has been updated to reflect the new rewrite
	  mechanism.
	* Andreas' Query Library work (rewriting the previous query
	  library and making it extensible) is almost complete and the
	  current version is included in this checkin.  The
	  documentation has been update to include example of how the
          new Query Ligrary works.
	* Added Andrea's documentation for the new Query library to the
	  ROSE documentation.
	* Generated prefixfrom global scope and fixed unparser bugs that
	  prevented unparsing of system header file declarations.
	* Fixed bugs in unparser that prevented generation of the correct
	  code for several declarations (in test codes: test2003_24.C,
	  test2003_25.C,test2003_26.C)
	* Added case for generation of file info data from template
	    (sageSupport.C).
	* Added ROSE/Query/ProjectQuery to permit access to Sgproject node
	    from any other node in the AST.  This query uses Markus's new
	    reverse traversal to assend to the root of the AST.
	* Fixed SgProject::parse() function to set parent of files to the
	    project (was previously not set).  This was required for the
	    ProjectQuery.
	* Added SgTypedefType in the TransformationSupport::getTypeName(SgType*)
	  function (to the cases supported there).  Bug reported by Brian
	    Miller.
	* Added (Andreas's work) all other cases in 
	  TransformationSupport::getTypeName(SgType*).  Flushed out other
	  cases within other TransformationSupport functions.
	* Fixed bug in SgLocatedNode::addToAttachedPreprocessingInfo() to
	    add new comments/directives closer to the associated
	    statement.
	* Added new function to manipulate the commandline in the SgFile object:
               void $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_File::addCommandLineArgument ( 
                         char** & inputCommandLine, 
                         int & numberOfCommandLineArguments, 
                         char* newArgument )
	* Included Boyana's modification to ROSE/makelinks script.
	  But had to remove it when it didn't work for me on a fresh
	  checkout from CVS.
	* Fixed spelling mistake: changed name of AST_RewiteMechanism to
          AST_RewriteMechanism.  Fixed related spelling errors in
	  documentation.	
	* Removed AstProcessing/AstRestructure.C from
	    libastprocessing_a_SOURCES in Makefile.am (it requires
	    the old AST Rewrite Mechanism which no longer exists).
	* Removed msDevelopment from SUBDIRS in 
	  ROSE/Makefile.am (it and the OmpTransformations directory require
	  the old AST Rewrite Mechanism which no longer exists).
	* Removed ContainerParallelizer directory from SUBDIRS in
	  ROSE/Makefile.am.  We have a ExamplePreprocessors directory 
	  for the project of the month sort of directories.  If that is
	  not good enough then we should perhaps have a special PROJECTS
	  directory for such work.  We need to avoid polluting the root
	  level ROSE directory.
	* Moved these static variable declarations to the AgDefaultError.C 
	  file from the AgDefaultError.h file since it to avoid compiler 
	  warnings about unused varables (-Wall warnings under g++):
	          static FILE *lst;
	          static char SourceName[]={'s','o','u','r','c','e'};
	* Added configure switches to permit use of alternate header files
	  when using EDG front-end.  See configure --help for details.
	  switches are available for GNU, INTEL, and any user specified
	  directory of header files.  INTEL header files are not included
	  yet while we pursue licensing issues.
	* Added preprocessed (translated) GNU 2.96 header files to ROSE
	  (in ROSE/GNU_HEADERS) to permit use of GNU_HEADERS with other
	  compilers.  This is expected to simplify use of GNU 3.x
	  compilers with the GNU 2.96 headers.  Note that the headers
	  are only important for ROSE processing the back-end compiler
	  always uses its own header files (our attempt is to provide
	  a consistant solution).
	* Fixed varargs mechanism:
	    1) processing of back-end compiler's header files recognizes 
	       varargs.h and stdarg.h and inserts code at the top to
	       over-rides whatever is in those files and inserts either
	        #include "rose_varargs.h" or #include "rose_stdarg.h"
	    2) rose_varargs.h and rose_stdarg.h differ only in that
	       the macro va_start takes 2 parameters in rose_stdarg.h
	       and only 1 parameter n rose_varargs.h.
	    3) The macros defined (required for the variable arguments
	       mechanism):
	       #define va_start(parmN) "ROSE-MACRO-EXPRESSION:va_start("#parmN")"
	       #define va_arg(ap,type) (type)"ROSE-MACRO-EXPRESSION:va_arg("#ap","#type")"
	       #define va_end(ap)      "ROSE-MACRO-EXPRESSION:va_end("#ap")"
	       The effect is to generate strings which are then unparsed
	       with special code (this is a stardard ROSE mechanism for
	       macro processing).  The unparsed code is identical to the 
	       input code so that all vararg macros are preserved.
	       Ths feature takes advantage of "X""Y" being same as 
	       equivalent to "XY" (a interesting feature of C strings).
	    4) Some additional vararg specific defines are include.
	* Cleaned up repositories docs directory. Removed old Sage++
	  documents (ROSE/docs/Sage_Docs direcoty). Removed old ROSE 
	  documentation (ROSE/docs/ROSE directory).
	* Removed (cvs remove) old AST_RewiteMechanism (the misspelled
	  version of the directory).  This however clears all CVS
	  history, but the new AST rewrite mechanism is so different
	  that it should not make much difference.
	* Added more test codes to the dqDevelopmentDirectory directory.
	  Most represent fixed bugs and some represent outstanding bugs
	  not all are currently run by "make check", this wil be fixed in
	  the future.
	* Added current ROSE research papers ROSE/ROSE_ResearchPapers.
	  See ROSE/ROSE_ResearchPapers/README for details and summary of
	  research papers on ROSE.
	* Added Nil's database example codes. New codes added to:
	  ExamplePreprocessors/DocumentedExamples/DataBaseExamples.
	  Since we don't yet have the data base configuration setup
	  the data base can not yet be used within ROSE and the example
	  codes that appear in the documentation are not tested.  
	* Added Nil's documentation for using the data base within ROSE.
	  We use the mySQL database, which we will not include in ROSE and
	  which will have to be installed separately (future configure
	  command line options will let ROSE know where the data base is
	  installed so that it can be used.
	* Added docs/Rose/AstRewrite/AstRewrite.tex to document rewrite
	  system.
	* Added docs/Rose/ProgramAnalysis/ProgramAnalysis.tex to document
	  future documentation related to program analysis.
	* Added docs/Rose/SAGE_III/SageIII.tex to document details
	  specific to SAGE III (history, new features, etc.)
	* Added config/rose_stdarg.h to permit isolation of code to
	  include in the stdarg.h file (insertion included in header
	  file translation). Same thing done for varargs.h.
	  config/stdarg_handling_commands.sed file contains translation 
	  commands (uses sed).  Same mechanism provide for varargs.h.
	* Fixed SCRIPTS/find_cvs_conflicts script to correctly report
	  conflicts introduced by CVS (searches for "<<<<" which is
	  common to all locations where conflicts are reported by CVS).
	* Added many chenges to A++/P++ translator, but this is still
	  not ready to be compiled with the new version of the rewrite
	  system. This code is checked in, but the A++P++ translator is
	  not compiled and tested within this current release.
	* Commented out "BUGFIX" message in
	  AstProcessingLib/AstClearVisitFlags.C (since it a 90% of all I/O when 
	  debugging the rewrite test codes.) 
	* Modified function declaration to make it static:
	  (in AstProcessingLib/AstProcessing.h)
	  static string get_variantName(unsigned int v);
	* Commented out AstRestructure.C since it requires
	  AstRestructure.h which requires old version of rewrite system.
	  This also creates a circular header file dependence.
	* Fixed problem in rose_varargs.h and rose_stdargs.h (very strange
	  problem) where a redundnet typedef "typedef char* va_list;"
	  caused one of the LoopProcessing tests (lufac.C) to fail.
	  The test caused an alternative correct result but failed to
	  match the expected result (so diff failed).  Not clear why this
	  redundent typedef cause such a problem. but removing caused the 
	  "gmake distcheck" to pass all tests where as previous to the 
	  fix only the "make check" test passed and "gmake distcheck"
	  failed (very mysteriously).  The LoopProcessing tests were 
	  not modified.

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********
	

2003-10-16 Markus Schordan 0.5.35a
	* Added class AstProcessingLib/AstRestructuring
	    - immediateReplace(SgNode*,string) (uses the Rewrite system)
            - unparserReplace(SgExpression* node, string s) (allows to modify expressions. The unparser
	         unparses the string s instead of the subtree with node 'node' as root node. 
	* Deactivated pdf file generation in rewrite system (ASTFragmentContainer.C)
	  (this causes too many errors in valgrind due to uninitialized values in AST nodes,
	   needs to be fixed in ROSETTA: if no constructor is generated, values are not initialized!)
        * Added function 'string SgNode::unparseToCompleteString()'
	  - The string returned includes all whitespaces and comments
	  - added set_SkipWhitespaces, unset_SkipWhitespaces, SkipWhitespaces to SgUnparse_Info
	  - adapted globalUnparseToString to use this new functions but ensure the original behaviour
	    of unparseToString(), which does not unparse comments and whitespaces
        * Fixed Dependencies in AstProcessingLib/Makefile.am
        * Changed algorithm for selection of successors in selectReverseBranchSuccessors
	* added CocoPreprocessor (only used for grammar-based transformations)
	* added Grammar-based OpenMP transformation in ROSE/ContainerParallelizer
	  - CPTransformation contains Coco grammars
	  - the generated abstract parser modifies the AST by using AstRestructure
	  - it uses the analysis in CPAnalysis
	* fixed Analysis/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS was empty, make dist failed)
	* fixed LoopProcessing/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS was empty, make dist failed)

 . Fixed bugs in LoopProcessing and improved dependence analysis. Also added BreakupStatement
   transformation for rmatmult3.c in IRS and added innermost loop fission transformation.

  . Added directory "Analysis", which should contain general analysis of the AST. right now it
    containers a AST interface class CPPAstInterface.C and StmtInfoAnal.C (collect mod, read and
    function invocation info from a AST tree)

  . Added directory ContainerParallelizer and ContainerParallelizer/CPAnalysis, which includes
    analysis functions for automatic parallelization of user defined containers (ref LCPC'03).

 . Added ExamplePreprocessors/AstCopyReplTester/astCopyReplTest.C, which tests the deep copy
   and statement replacement implementations in SAGE on the input program.
 . Added LoopProcessing/test/TestLoopProcessor.C and
   LoopProcessing/test/(mm.C, lufac.C and tridvpk.C), which test the loop blocking and
   fusion implementations.
 . Fixed bugs in LoopProcessing, and changed the interface of DepInfo analysis, split
   the analysis implementation out of DepInfoAnal.C and into DepInfoAnalImpl.C.
 . In ROSETTA/Statement.code, rewrote interfaces and implementations for insert_statement,
   replace_statement and remove_statement. Fixed the last checkin of replace_statement,
   which implicitly extract all statements from a replacing basic block. Basic blocks can
   now be processed as a normal statement, and to allow using basic block as a statement
   list, we also provide an interface named insert/replace_statement_from_basicBlock.
 . In ROSETTA/src/(grammarString.C, terminal.C), fixed bugs in last checkin of deep copy
   for variable declarations.
 . In ROSETTA/src/statement.C, removed the original editting of COMMON_INSERT_STATEMENT
   because they are no longer necessary (with the new implementation of insert_statement).

	* Modified Ast*Processing classes to allow customization of 
	  traversals. The successors of each node are defined by the function
	  setSuccessorsContainer.
	* Added 8 classes allowing the traversal of the AST in reverse order.
	  The interfaces are the same as in the Ast*Processing classes.
          AstReversePrefixSimpleProcessing
	  AstReversePrefixInhProcessing
	  AstReversePrefixSynProcessing
	  AstReversePrefixInhSynProcessing
	
          AstReverseBranchSimpleProcessing
          AstReverseBranchInhProcessing
          AstReverseBranchSynProcessing
          AstReverseBranchInhSynProcessing
	
	* Added class AstSuccessorsSelectors which containes all
	  functions used to select successors.
	  (except the inFileToTraverse function which is still in SgTreeTraversal)
	* Modified AstTests to test instantiation of all new templated classes.
	* TreeTraversal classes:
	  - removed function traverseUpperContext
	  - added typedef for "SynthesizedAttributesList". Can be used instead of "SubTreeSynthesizedAttributes".
	  - removed traverseMode from all classes
	  - removed struct NodePerfData
	  - removed performanceDataToString()
	  - removed performanceDataInit() 
	  - removed class AstProcessingPerformance

	 * changed class AgProcessing to take a template parameter Parser.
	 * changed Makefile.am in AstProcessingLib to not specify noinst_HEADER
	 * added README_CHECKIN which describes the steps required when
	   checking in a new version of ROSE.

	* Fixed configuration system to modify the varargs.h file copied
	  into the ROSE compiler header files directory. This permits
	  applications using the varargs macros to compile, but not
	  definition of the macros has yet been found that permits 
	  both EDG and g++ 2.96 to used and the executable work
	  properly.  Presently any file using the varargs macros should
	  skip being processed by ROSE.  No mechanism is presently
	  available to detect and/or skip processing for a specific
	  file.  To be clear ROSE will compile varargs macros, but the
	  generated code from the macro expansion will not execute
	  correctly.  This work was done to support compilation of the
	  IRS code (LLNL test code used with ROSE to test C support).
	  Added ROSE/config/rose_varargs.h to hold new macro definitions
	  for varargs, and sed script (vararg_handling_commands.sed).

	* Added ExamplePreprocessor/OpenMPPreprocessor/parallelSTLQuery.C showing the 
	  analysis associated with how to transform the use of iterators 
	  to use OpenMP for STL like containers (example used for paper).
	  Includes test code parallelSTLQuery_testFile.C as well.

1. Changes related to file_info for variable and function declarations
   in sage_gen_be.C:
    - fixed file_info fields for variable and function declarations so that
      they contain declaration positions in the original code instead
      of the corresponding definition positions.
    - changed the definition pointers in variable and function declarations:
      set the definition pointer to NULL unless the declaration is also a
      definition in the original file (this matches the the traversal order
      of AST with the original source file).
    - For function declarations, a new forward pointer is added for
      retrieving the definitions of the function declarations.
2. Changes to LoopProcessing code
   - added dynamic tuning for loop fusion
   - fixed bugs
   - added documentation
3. Changes to ROSETTA
   - added configurable tree-copy functionality to SAGE AST (member function 'copy'
     with configurations SgSHALLOW_COPY and SgTREE_COPY).
   - filled in implementations for replacing statement and expression subtrees, including
     member functions 'replace_statement' in SgStatement and 'replace_expression' in
     SgExpression.
   - fixed bugs in sharing Sgfile_info at SgExpressionRoot.
   - removed redundant pointers to expressions in SgForStatement. Accesses to increment and
     test expressions in SgForStatement now go through the corresponding ExpressionRoots.
4. fixed two bugs in unparse_format.C and unparse_stmt.C

2003-07-02 Markus Schordan 0.5.30a

	* added abstract C++ grammar parser (generated with Coco)
	  - the grammar is tested in all tests
	  - I've checked in the generated files (coco is not invoked yet)
	* added Coco (a LL(1) parser tool)
	* added some AST Fixes to AstFixes.C
	  - SgNewExp had sometimes the SgConstructorInitializer not set (this is fixed
	    as part of the SAGE/AstFixes.[hC] (the problem only shows up in 2 test files!)

	* Changes of traversal:
	  - TypedefDeclaration: 'type' changed from TYPE_TRAVERSAL to DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL
	  - SgNamedType: changed member 'declaration' 
	    from DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL
	    (when including type information this was a cycle in the traversal)
	  - SgFunctionParameterTypeList: changed member 'arguments' from
	    TYPE_TRAVERSAL to DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL.
	  - SgName: 'TemplateArgs': changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL
	            'TemplateParams': changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL
	  - TypedefSeq:'typedefs': changed from TYPE_TRAVERSAL to DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL
	  - DefaultSymbol:'type': changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL
	  - FunctionTypeSymbol: 'type' changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL
	  - Unparse_Info: 'type' changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL
	  - Unparse_Info: 'current_context' changed from DEF_TRAVERSAL to NO_TRAVERSAL

2003-05-26 Dan Quinlan 0.5.29a
	* Fixed numerous bugs to get B-div IRS code to compile and
	    unparse correctly with ROSE.
	* Added -rose:C_Only option to permit input code to be C instead
	    of C++ (this permits more flexible, less strict, handling).
	* Removed ROSE/src/ROSE_Unparser.h and ROSE/src/ROSE_Unparser.C
	    source files.
	* Fixed numerous bugs in unparser.
	* Fixed numerous bugs EDG/Sage connection code
	* Added traverse to root AST traversal
	    (ROSE/AstProcessingLib/AstTraverseToRoot.h)
	*

        * added 'LoopProcessing' directory, which implements various loop
	  transformations, including loop interchange, fusion, distribution,
	  and blocking to optimize programs for better locality. For details of
	  the implementation, see the 'Loop Processing' section 
	  (to be included in the ROSE documentation, soon).
	* added another class, UnparseFormat, into the unparser code to
	  facilitate flexible formating of the output code. This class
	  can be configured to accept outside instructions on the line
	  and column numbers of SgLocatedNode, and if no such FormatHelp
	  class is provided, it applies a default clean formating.

2003-04-28 Markus Schordan 0.5.26b
	* added recognition of '\n' for AstAttribute strings in PDF files
	  (PDF requires to position text explicitely)
	* added tool cpp2beauty (uses a C++ beautifier which I found
	  in the internet, the beautifier is not part of ROSE.
	  The beautifier,bcpp, should be installed on your system).
	  bcpp is a C/C++ beautifier
          download bcpp from: http://dickey.his.com/bcpp/bcpp.html
	* Some changes in ROSETTA (does not effect generated code)
	* changed -ll to $(LEXLIB) in ROSE/config/Makefile.for.ROSE.includes.and.libs
	  to use the installed lex/flex lib determined by configure.

2003-04-07 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.26a
	* fixed numerous problems in the unparser and in the EDG/SAGE
	  connection related to autonomous types. Cases fixed and now
	  tested are in ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory/test2003_08.[h,C].
	
	* built fileFiler tool (not yet placed into tool directory) to
	    preprocess input files (source files to ROSE preprocessors) to
	    remove Carriage Returns and optionally expand all tabs.
	    - removing CR's was a bug submitted by Beata which EDG fails
	    to parse.
	    - expanding tabs is important if the column numbers are ever
	    be exact in later work on source code formatting.
	  The C++ program demonstrating the input file processing is
	  automatically built and tested with "make" and "make check"
	  and is in ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory/fileFilter.C.

	* worked on the AST rewrite mechanism and fixed numerous bugs
	  found by trying to build new OpenMP preprocessor and finish
	  A++/P++ preprocessor.

	* started work on the OpenMP preprocessor in the 
	  ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/OpenMPPreprocessor directory.

2003-03-20 Markus Schordan 0.5.25a

	* fixed bug in parsing multiple files (error code was only
	  reported for last file parsed)
	* Changed following interfaces:
	  new: SgProject* frontend(int  argc, char** argv).
	  old: SgProject& frontend(int& argc, char** argv, int& errorCode) 
	  The errorCode can be accessed with the SgProject member function 
	  get_frontendErrorCode() 

	  new: int backend(SgProject* project)
	  old: int backend(SgProject& project) 
	  The return value is the error code.
	  The errorCode can also be accessed with the SgProject member function 
	  get_backendErrorCode()

	* added Translator class in Translator.h/C to MSTL to offer an interface
	  for building compiler/translator/preprocessor/transformation tools
	* created CppToCppTranslator, CppToDotTranslator, CppToPdfTranslator
	        RoseTestTranslator classes to roseTranslators.h/C
	* modified DotGenerator, now implemented as CppToDotTranslator
	* modified PdfGenerator, now implemented as CppToPdfTranslator
	
	* set ROSE_LIBS such that it contains all libs that are necessary
	  to link with a preprocessor.
	  - all makefiles in ExamplePreprocessors have been updated
	  - in Makefile.am you can use now: LDADD = $(ROSE_LIBS) 
	  - removed outdated comments in several makefiles

	* added tools cpp2cpp, cpp2dot, cpp2pdf, dot2ps, lsviz in the tools
	  directory. The tools use various preprocessors/translators.
	  ALL tools have a user friendly command line interface
	  All tools conform to the GNU standard, --help gives a description
	  there is a README file in the tools directory that contains more info

	  The tools are installed in the bin directory
	  use configure with --prefix=<MYDIR>,
	  and run 'make install' - the tools will be installed in <MYDIR>/bin.
	  Note that some tools use preprocessors and therefore only
	  work if <MYDIR>/bin is included in $PATH.
	
	* turned off verbose mode in unparser (see unparser.h)
	* turned off ROSE_INTERNAL_DEBUG mode
	* Initial work on allowing to have different ASTs in memory
	  * SgProject and SgFile:
	    * int defaultNumberOfCommandLineArguments is no longer static
	    * char** defaultCommandLineArgumentList is no longer static

	  * SgProject:
	    initial work to allow to have a container of SgProject nodes
	    the default constructor can be used now and parse(argc,argv) needs
	    to be called on such objects. (this separates commandline parsing
	    from invoking the frontend)
	    * added public parse(argc,argv), 
	    initial work to separate general commandline handling from 
	    parsing of single files (does not affect public interface)
	    * added private
	        * processCommandLine(argc,argv)
	        * parseEachInputFile()

2003-03-06 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.24a
	* Fixed the parent pointers and implemented tests to verify that
          they are all set correctly. The code that sets and tests the
	  parent pointers is in ROSE/SAGE/AstFix.[h,C].
	* Removed the "SgStatement get_parent()" member function in SgStatement
	* Removed the "SgExpression get_parent()" member function in SgExpression
	* Removed the "SgStatement get_parent()" member function in SgType
	* Removed the "SgStatement get_parent()" member function in SgSymbol
	* Added a single "SgNode* get_parent()" member function to the SgNode class.
	* Modified use of get_parent() member fucntion every where in ROSE
	    to force the cast to SgStatement, SgExpression, SgType, or
	    SgSymbol if required (only required in a few places).
	* Added functionality to set the parent pointers to correct values
	  (initializes uninitialized values and resets values set
	  incorrectly by SAGE).  For debugging purposes, we builds a
	  list internally of nodes that are modified from values set or 
	  unitialized by SAGE.
	* Added test on AST generated by SAGE and modified after AST fixup
	  phase to verify that every node in the AST can be traversed
	  along the chain of parents to reach the SgFile node. This test
	    plus other tests in AstProcessing will be consolidated into
	    the ROSE/SAGE directory later (similarly to the
	    SAGE/AstFix.[h,C]).
	* Added documentation rules to makefiles in ROSE, ROSE/docs, and 
	  ROSE/docs/Rose directories.

        * SgForStatement:
	  Changed the order of successors in the traversal to
	  new order: init_stmt, test_expr_root, increment_expr_root, loop_body
	  old order: loop_body, test_expr_root, increment_expr_root, init_stmt
          note: the order in which successors are traversed can be found in
	        <yourcompiletree>/SAGE/Cxx_Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalAccessEnums.h
	* (experimental) : added statistics to traversal objects
	  the plan is to measure execution times of the 
	  evaluate functions (not finished yet) for types of nodes.

2003-02-17 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.21a
	* Fixed Sage nodes generated by EDG/Sage III interface code to
	  generate unique Sg_File_Info objects and use the best info
	  possible to generate their Sg_File_Info object.  Since source
	  position information is not available for operators within EDG
	  so the current_source_position is used if it is a valid pointer.
	  As a last resort the NULL_FILE macro is used to generate a
	  Sg_File_Info object.
	* Added directory of tests for testing standard compiler options.
	  The ROSE/TESTS/CompilerOptionsTests/A++Code directory is a copy
	  of the A++ source files, the Makefile has a "make check" rule
	  which tests the "-E" option on the ROSE/src/rose executable (in
	  the compile tree).  The -E option is passed to the backend C++
	  compiler, the makefile runs the preprocessor and directs the
	  output to a new file and compiles that file (to make sure that 
 	  the output of the -E option applied to a preprocessor build
	  using ROSE generates code that can be compiled.

2003-02-16 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.20a
	* Significant additions to the rewrite mechanism
	     - fixed many bugs
	     - built mechanism to construct declarations used in compiling
               intermediate files
	* Modified the attachment of comments and CPP directives to the AST
	* Fixed EDG/SAGE connection to report the ending braces of all
	    block type language constructs (enums, classes, basic blocks).
	    Also fixed the accuracy of the file info objects recorded in
	    many SAGE objects.  Added support for this in SAGE III as well.
	* Many additional bugs fixed through out ROSE and the EDG/SAGE
	    interface.
	* Added additional documentation
	* Added new function to generate Sg_File_Info objects within the
	    EDG/SAGE connection code.
	* Added a "make installcheck" rule (called automatically by "make
	    distcheck" rule.  This new rule tests the use of the
	    directories build by "make install" by compiling an example
	    preprocessor using only the new include and lib directories
	    in the location specified by the "prefix" variable (specified
	    on "configure" commandline during initial configuration).
	* removed use of roseString.h file (we now only use the C++
	    strings instead of building a separate string library that
	    is similar to the C++ strings if it is not supported by the
	    target compiler). As a result we are not dependent upon C++
	    compilers that implement the C++ standard string library.
	* The scalar indexing transformation in the A++P++ preprocessor
	    now uses the new rewrite interface, the other array statement
	    transformation does not yet use the new rewrite interface.
	* Defined a new high-level interface for access to the ROSE
	    preprocessor. We now have a simple frontend() and backend()
	    function which simplifies the interface (and the use of
	    standard compiler options (e.g. -E).
	* ROSE preprocessors now use the -E and -H options properly.
	    No test code is presently in place to test this.
	* Improved output from unparser (part of work on how comments and
	    CPP directives are output within the code generation phase.
	* Code generated by unparser now includes all CPP directives
	    (most were previously commented out).  An option to
	    alternatively output all header files into the generated 
	    output is not yet implemented.
	* Output from cvschk:

2003-01-09 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.19?
	* Modified Makefile.am files to set INCLUDE= $(ROSE_INCLUDES)
	    which is defiled in the common makefile included from
	    ROSE/config (Makefile.for.ROSE.includes.and.libs).
	    This simplifies how we can keep the list of directories
	    where we have header files maintained.
	* Fixed more bugs in the AST Rewrite mechanism
	* Added feature to record all declarations in an accumulated
	    attribute.  This permits us to generate a string required for
	    compilation of intermediate files.
	* Added include guards to ROSE/src/optionDeclaration.h.
	
2003-01-27 Markus Schordan 0.5.19e
	* added output of version number for Latex, html2latex, and doxygen
	  to ROSE/SCRIPTS/cvschk
	* fixed bug in class SgEnumType. The data member type is no longer included	
	  in the default traversal.
	* added documentation for Ast*Processing classes.
	* AstDOTProcessing: the name of the enums for traversal types have been
	  changed to be written in capital letters:
	  enum traversalType {PREORDER, POSTORDER, TOPDOWN ,BOTTOMUP 
	                      ,TOPDOWNBOTTOMUP}

2003-01-09 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.19c
	* Edited documentation to correct many minor typos.
	* Added chapter on "Getting Started", includes figures that ate
	  automatically generated from the running specific
	  preprocessors (notes in the documentation are generated if
	  ROSE has not been built).	
	* Added Markus's perl script so that it is run and generates
	  the directory map figure in the Implementation chapter.
	
2003-01-09 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.19b
	* Added make installcheck rule
	* Added test to make sure the ROSE can be used to build one of the
	    example preprocessors after make install is run (example used
	    the ROSE/include and ROSE/libs directories only).
	* Added documentation "Getting Started" chapter for users.
	  Shows and example preprocessor and makefile for use after
	  make install has been run. Same as is tests by make
	    installcheck.
	* Added Markus's perl script output to show the directory
	    structure of the ROSE project.  This will be modified later
	    to get it integerated better.
	* Added more documentation.
	
2003-01-09 Markus Schordan Version 0.5.19a
	* added a tool for generating a visualization of a directory structure
	  this shall be used for documentation in ROSE. It uses the tool 'dot'
	  and is stored in ROSE/SCRIPTS/lsvis. (renamed to lsdot in V0.5.19d)
	  It may be used for any other directories as well.
	
2003-01-06 Dan Quinlan Version 0.5.18a
	* Added Latex documentation (ROSE User Manual) in perparation of
	  release to SciDAC PERC project.
	  The latex documentation is built from ROSE/docs/Rose with "make latex-docs"
	  and produces a postscript file UserManual.ps.  
	  "make html-docs" produces an html version of the latex
	  UserManual and provides links to the postscript version of the 
	  documentation and links in the Reference chapter to the Doxygen
          generated documentation.
	* Added documentation to SAGE III so that Doxygen generated
	    documentation is better.  More work is required here.
	* Added documentation to ROSE/AST_RewriteMechanism source code
	  to improve documentation of both user level and developer level
	  documentation generated by Doxygen.
	* Added documentation to EDG, QueryLib, etc.
	* Added examples to latex documentation and put examples into
	  ExamplePreprocessors/DocumentedExamples/SimplePreprocessorExamples
	  ExamplePreprocessors/DocumentedExamples/AstRewriteExamples
	  ExamplePreprocessors/DocumentedExamples/AstProcessingExamples
	  These examples are not compiled with the rest of the example
	  codes which should force them to track any changes in the
	  interfaces (and allow the documenation to be automatically
	  kept up-to-date.  All the Makefile.am are built and have been
	  added to the CVS repository.  Code fragments that appear in
	  the latex documentation can also be placed into these
	  directories. No attempt has been made to compile the code
	  fragments.
	* Documentation should be such that other developers can add there
	  parts to the existing documentation easily.  All makefiles are
	  provided with rules to make this simple (I hope).

2003-01-03 Markus Schordan Version 0.5.17b
	* fixed problem with multiple SgMemberFunctionDeclarations for
	  a single SgFunctionDefintion node. The definition pointer in
	  SgMemberFunctionDeclaration is now nullified if
	  another SgMemberFunctionDeclaration node exists from which a pointer
	  refers to SgFunctionDefinition.
	  The "old" pointer is copied in the new data member "definition_ref".
	  This data is not used by the backend.
	  The fix is implemented in SAGE/AstFixes.[hC]
	  This finishes the work on the AST to remove all cycles and multiple
	  paths in the traversal.
	* fixed a problem in the new DotGeneration output (it showed nodes 
	  that where not visited when using traverseInputFiles)
	* extended cvschk in SCRIPTS to print version numbers of tools used
	  when checking in. I've added the "TESTED WITH" part after
	  ":Extra file .." because it's the part after "Extra files" that is
	  used in ChangeLog.
	* this version compiles with g++3.2 but the 3.2 header files cannot
	  be parsed with the EDG version we are using right now. Therefore
	  g++ 2.96 still must be used.

2002-12-30 Markus Schordan Version 0.5.17a
	* solved all remaining problems in accessing synthesized attributes by
	  adding new types of nodes to SAGE to ensure that a node either
	  contains single successor pointers or a container (but not
	  both).
	  - the remaining 42 problematic nodes are now correct. There are no
	    problematic nodes left. This work is finished.
	    access names for synthesized attributes can be found in 
	    SAGE/Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalAccessEnums.h
	  - added SgFunctionParameterTypeList
	  - added SgTypedefSeq (abbrevitation Seq is used because it's also used
	    in the C++98 grammar definition and we try to use the same names
	    where possible)
	  - affected Sage nodes are:
	    : replaced "SgTypePtrList typedefs" with "SgTypedefSeq* typedefs" in the following nodes:
		SgType
		SgTypeUnknown
		SgTypeChar
		SgTypeSignedChar
		SgTypeUnsignedChar
		SgTypeShort
		SgTypeSignedShort
		SgTypeUnsignedShort
		SgTypeInt
		SgTypeSignedInt
		SgTypeUnsignedInt
		SgTypeLong
		SgTypeSignedLong
		SgTypeUnsignedLong
		SgTypeVoid
		SgTypeGlobalVoid
		SgTypeWchar

		SgTypeLongDouble
		SgTypeString
		SgTypeBool
		SgComplex
		SgTypeDefault
		SgReferenceType
		SgModifierType
		SgArrayType
		SgTypeEllipse
		SgNamedType
		SgPointerType
		SgNamedType
		SgEnumType
		SgNamedType
		SgTypedefType
		SgNamedType
		SgClassType
		SgTemplateInstantiationType
		SgPointerType
		SgPointerMemberType

	    : replaced SgTypePtrList typedefs with SgTypedefSeq*
	      AND replaced "SgTypePtrList arguments" with "SgParameterTypeList* arguments"
	      in the following Sage nodes:
		SgFunctionType
		SgMemberFunctionType
		SgMemberFunctionType
		SgPartialFunctionType
		SgMemberFunctionType

	* added an AST correctness test (which ensures that all 48 nodes
	which have been fixed with this version and 0.5.14a are correct
	for all test program codes.

	* removed generation of statistics when testing the AST (the new
	test covers more than the statistics did)

	* removed the generation of enums for access of synthesized attributes
	  for container nodes. (it is always wrong to use them on a container
	  node because the container has to be accessed using an iterator).
	  (in this checkin-version such nodes are put as comments in file
	  SAGE/Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalAccessEnums.h) 
	  - this required changes in ROSETTA (grammar.h/C)
	  - SgName enums are outcommented as well because it has two containers.
	    These containers will be changed and should not be used right now.
	
	EDG-SAGE connection fixes:
	* fixed warning and changed assert: ROSE/EDG/src/sageSupport.C:1182: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of
	  - the comparison asserted that a value of an unsigned type is >=0
	    which is always true. This test was removed.
	  - activated a test for column<=500 at the same location because
	    it is tested at other locations in the EDG/SAGE connection too.
	    (the absolute value of 500 for max columns das not really make
	     sense (they can have any value). Right now all tests pass this
	     artifical test but it may be removed in future.
	    (generated code may not be so nicely formated).

2002-22-20 Dan Quinlan: Version 0.5.15a
	* Added support for Doxygen generated documentation for Rose and
	    Sage.  Note that the option does not force any documentation 
	    to be developed currently, since we don't what the build
	    process or Rose to be dependent upon the availablity of
	    Doxygen software (3rd party software).  If Doxygen is
	    available in your environment (path) then running
	    "make rose-docs" or "make sage-docs" from the
	    "ROSE/docs/Rose" directory will generate all documentation
	    (into ROSE/docs/Rose/html and
	    ROSE/docs/Rose/SageIntermediateForm/html respectively).

	    - The Goal of this work is to provide a template for the
	      addition of new documentation into Rose by all developers.
	      The existing files should provide a template for each
	      developer to follow.  Please see Dan for any problems
	      in documenting your sections of Rose.

	    - Generates either DEVELOPER or USER level documentation:
	         USER level documentation only documents the user relavant
	         parts of the public interface.  The level of doxygen
	         generated documentation is controled by a Rose configure
		 option.  The default is to generate USER level
		 documentation:  The Rose configure option:
		      --enable-doxygen-developer-docs
		 forces the generation of DEVELOPER level documentation.

	    - Generates documentstion specific to Sage III merged into Rose
	         documentation either the "fast way" using Doxygen Tag
	         files or merged with Rose in a more presentable way (the
	         slow way).  The fast way makes it much easier to work
		 on the documentation, but the slow way builds better
		 looking documentation.  Current the default is to
	         build the documentation the more presentable way.
		 The Rose configure option:
		      --enable-doxygen-generate-fast-docs
		 permits the faster generation of Doxygen documentation.
	
	    - Added many new files many representing locations to place
	      documentation for different parts of Rose (in each directory).

	    - Generation of dDoxygen documentation from an automatically
	      generated distribution (automake generated dist rule) may
	      still not work properly.  This will be added next.  I wanted
	      to get the initial documentation mechanism into place so
	      that developers could use it.  It is just as available to
	      anyone checking out a version from CVS, but perhaps not
	      complete for anyone recieving a generated distribution.

2002-12-20 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.14a
	* solved various problems in accessing synthesized attributes by
	  adding new types of nodes to SAGE to ensure that a node either
	  contains single successor pointers or a container (but not
	  both).
	  - added SgCatchStatementSeq to SAGE.
	    and adapted all code that uses SgTryStatement
	  - added SgParameterList to SAGE
	    and adapted all code that uses SgFunctionDeclaration
	  - added SgCtorInitialiserList to SAGE
	    add adapted all code that uses SgMemberFunctionDeclaration
	  NOTE: the shape of the AST has changed for code that is represented
	        by such nodes. More nodes are processed now when traversing
	        the AST. The access names for synthesized attributes
	        (see SAGE/Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalAccessEnums.h) are now
	        always correct offsets.
	  NOTE: "user code" example:
		Although we have made some changes to the structure of the AST
	        not any class of the AstProcessing classes (DOT/PDF/Statistics
	        generation) had to be modified but shows all new nodes in the
	        output.
	* changed all files in AstProcessingLib and MSTL to resolve includes
	  properly such that for a preprocessor it's sufficient now to include
	  rose.h only (we include different files in AstProcessingLib and MSTL)
	* added cvs code $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.188 2008/01/26 05:08:37 dquinlan Exp $ to all files in AstProcessingLib and MSTL to
	  show the author (who checked in the latest version), date, and
	  version number of that file.
	        
	* identified some bugs in ROSE
	  unparser:
	  	- catch statement
	             catch(int x) is unparsed to catch(int x;)
		- for statement
		     for(int x,y; ...) is unparsed to for(int x; int y;)
	  EDG-SAGE connection:
	        - the list-expression operator (also called comma operator)
	          cannot be parsed
	          examples:
	          i) z=x,y;
	          ii) for(i=1,j=2; ...)

2002-12-13 Dan Quinlan: Version 0.5.13a
	* Removed old version of STL
	* Fixed many bugs and added features to AST rewrite mechanism
	* Moved numerous example preprocessors to
	    ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors directory. Reloated numerous files
	    to better positions within directory structure and cleaned up
	    the directory structure in preparation of internal PERC
	    release.
	* Removed use of PerlEnabledTestingFramework (old testing package)
	* Removed older versions of A++ preprocessor (several years old
	    and superceeded by new version (A++P++Preprocessor) in the
	    ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors directory.
	* Fixed numerous bugs and cleaned up A++P++Preprocessor
	* Added transformation specific to scalar indexing to
	    A++P++Preprocessor.
	* Added initial work on Data structure analysis preprocessor (part
	    of what Bronis referes to as the "Universal Translator").
	* Added Bable Preprocessor (generates SIDL from C++ header files).
	    This is initial work on the automated wrapping of libraries
	    using BABEL.
	* Added incomplete AccessPatternPreprocessor example for Bronis.
	* SvPablo Preprocessor NOT added yet (will add in next release).
	* Files changed/added/removed:

	********* WARNINGS *********

2002-12-11 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.12a
	* moved all SgProcessing classes to AstProcessingLib
	  (and are no longer generated by ROSETTA)
	  - user code has to be changed as follows:
	    if rose.h is included: remove #include "Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalClass.h"
	    otherwise: replace #include "Cxx_GrammarTreeTraversalClass.h" 
	                  with #include "AstProcessing.h"
	  - modified all files in ROSE to reflect this change
	  - for all 4 Sg*Processing classes the prefix "Sg" has been replaced
	    with "Ast".(e.g. AstSimpleProcessing instead of SgSimpleProcessing)
	    the old name SgSimpleProcessing (etc.) is deprecated
	  - deleted all code in grammar.C generating traversal classes
	    and removed some dead code (removed 38K source code total)
	  - deleted all 9 treeTraversal*.code files
	* added SgForInitStatement added to SAGE. (This corrects a problem
	  in the access of synthesized attributes of SgForStatement)
	  note: this is a statement. Any code that handles all statements
	        needs to handle SgForInitStatement as well now.
	  - for compatibility ROSE::identifyVariant in ROSE/src/variant.C 
	    has been extended as well
	* modified definition of "Problematic Node" in grammar.C
	  (that's ongoing work)
	* The implementation of is$CLASSNAME, using variant() and a C-cast,
	  has been replaced by code using dynamic_cast.
	  ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar/grammarIsClassNameFunctionDefinitionMacros.macro
	  Remark: old code in this file and generation of $ACCUMULATION_STRING
	          not removed yet
	* removed the CPP language extentions ParForStatement 
	  and ParBlockStatement
	  NOTE: there was no code in the EDG-SAGE connection code. Hence,
	        the PAR constructs were never used in Sage.
	  changed:
 	    ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar/Statement.code, ROSE/ROSETTA/src/statement.C, 
	    ROSE/src/unparser/unparse_stmt.C, ROSE/src/show.C,

2002-11-07 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.11a
	* improved compilation time of ROSE by about 70% with g++
	  (from 18min to 5:30 min on my machine using one processor)
	* replaced uses of "strstream" by "sstream" (strstream is deprecated)
	  in all files in ROSE! (EDG-SAGE code, unparser, generated code,
	                         some tree traversals)
	  - removed "ends" where necessary.
	  - replaced "ostrstream" by "ostringstream" 
	  - in sage3.h: <sstream> is now included instead of <strstream.h>
	  - in EDG/src/sage_gen_be.C, sage_il_to_str.C several changes
	  - in src/unparser/unparser.C: a whole section has been rewritten
	  NOTE: (o)strstream has not been removed in the test files ;-)
	* added a (temporary) fix to ROSE that removes all cycles in
	  SgInitializedName node-pairs. It is implemented as TopDownProcessing
	  in SAGE/AstFixes.[hC]
	* added traversal/pdf/statistics tests to AstProcessingLib
	  - the tests are invoked in rose.C (to ensure that they succeed 
	    for all test programs).
	    the call in rose.C is AstTests::runAllTests(&sageProject);
	    in ROSE/AstProcessingLib/AstTests.[hC] the function
	    runAllTests(SgProject*) shows how PDF files and DOT files can
	    be easily generated.
	* improved the PDFGeneration interface:
	  - the constructor does no longer take a filename;
	  - generate(string filename, SgNode* node)
   	    the whole AST (including header files and all input files)
	    is written to a PDF file (".pdf" is appended to filename)
	  - generateInputFiles(SgProject*): generates all input files
	    but not AST fragments representing included files.
	    the filenames specified on the command line (of the preprocessor)
	    are used and ".pdf" is appended.
	  - generateWithinFile(SgFile*): same as above but with a single
	    file starting at a SgFile node.
	  - see MSTL/PDFGeneration.h
	        AstProcessingLib/AstPDFGeneration.h
	* added AstDOTGeneration to ROSE:
	   - this DOT generation is based on a traversal and creates the most
	     informative output:
	     numbers: in each node you can find two numbers: x:y
	     x represents a call of evaluateInheritedAttribute at this node
	     y represents a call of evaluateSynthesizedAttribute at this node
	     following the numbers shows the sequence in which all this functions
	     are called in a traversal
	     red edges: these are paths that are *not* traversed because a node
	                would be revisited.
	     orange nodes: these are problematic nodes because the
	                enum (=name) for accessing a synthesized attribute
	                might be wrong.
	     (a documentation will follow and is not checked in yet, explaining
	      some more features of these classes)
	   - the interface is the same as above for PDFGeneration
	   - see MSTL/DOTGeneration.h, 
                 AstProcessingLib/AstDOTGeneration.h
	* added scripts for translating dot files into ps to ROSE
	  - ROSE/SCRIPTS/dotgen
	    if one argument is specified the generated ps file is test.ps
	    e.g. dotgen testcode1.C.dot generates a file called test.ps
	    (use gv to view the file, gv test.ps & and set the option
	     "state->watch file". you never need to reopen a file, as long
	     as you always generate a test.ps)
	    e.g. dotgen testcode1.C.dot testcode1.C.ps
	    if two parameters are used the filenames specified are used.
	  - ROSE/SCRIPTS/dotgen2
	    same as dotgen but with filled node shapes (try which one works
	    best on your monitor)
	* sage_gen_be.C: fixed 22 cases of 2 kinds of warnings:
	  - warning: NULL used in arithmetic
	  - warning: passing NULL used for non-pointer argument 1 of ...
	  (lines: 428,1428,1466,1480,1761,3582,3629, 4052, 4474, 4476, 
	          5076, 5860, 5862, 12435, 12467, 14099, 14101, 14109, 
	          14111, 14580, 14837, 14846)
	  No code was associated with these tests (the tests are outcommented)
	  - 3 remaining warnings in sage_gen_be.C: 
	    "deleting `void *' is undefined"
	* sage_il_to_str.C: fixed a warning
	* the traversal has been devided up into:
	  - default traversal (DEF_TRAVERSAL)
	  - type traversal (TYPE_TRAVERSAL)
	  - and connecting paths between these two (DEF2TYPE_TRAVERSAL)
	  - no traversal (NO_TRAVERSAL)
	  the flags are defined in ROSE/ROSETTA/src/ROSETTA_macros.h
	  they flags are only used for debugging (or easy changes in the future)
	* fixed deprecated use of typenames in MSTL/AttributeMechanism.[hC]
	* fixed non-standard C++ use of "friend" in Support.code
	  (the error was reported when compiling Cxx_Grammar.h with gcc3.2)
	* fixed non-standard use of default values in headers and implementations
	  (in treeTraversalClassConstructor.code, treeTraversalClassTemplate.code)

2002-10-22 Dan Quinlan: Version 0.5.10a

	* Fixed configuration to remove default "-g -O2" from use with
	  g++.  Users must now use:
 	     configure --with-CXX_DEBUG=-g --with-C_DEBUG=-g --with-CXX_WARNINGS=-Wall --prefix=`pwd`
	  on Linux systems.  "-g" adds line number information to object
	  files and "-Wall" turns on more detailed warnings by the gcc and
	  g++ compiler.  "--prefix=`pwd`" tells configuration where to
	  place "include" and "lib" directories when "make install" is
	  run (done by distcheck rule).  NOTE: "-g -O2" is no longer the default when using gcc
	  and g++ compilers.

	* Fixed new AST Rewrite Mechanism to work with the newest version
          of the A++P++ preprocessor.  A++P++ Preprocessor works on
	  simple array statement transformations.  Scalar indexing
	  transformation is still incomplete.

	* Moved AST_Rewrite directory to top level since it requires the
 	  ROSE/src/librose.a library.

  	* Fixed bug in unparseToString when used with a SgGlobal
 	  object. Unparser::unparseStatement() asserted that line numbers
 	  were greater than zero, but the line number for a SgGlobal
 	  statement is always zero by definition.

	* Fixed numerous bugs in the AST rewrite mechanism.

	* Fixed EDG and ROSETTA to work with the SUN CC 5.2 compiler
          (version 6.1 of the SUN C++ environment).  This required
	  modifications to EDG/src/basics.h to avoid defining __WIN32__
	  and __MSDOS__ macros (they were defined by EDG to be 0 and
	  tested by the SUN's header files to see if they had been
	  defined, a common header file problem).

	* Fixed ROSE/util/string_functions.C to work with both GNU g++
	    (ver 2.96) and SUN CC (ver 5.2).  It previously only worked
	    for g++ (ver 2.96).

            // This does not work with SUN 5.1 C++ compiler, but is required for GNU g++
               #ifdef __GNUC__
               #include "algo.h"
               #endif

	  also the preinitialization lists must be different for each
	    compiler (in the
	    ROSE/A++P++Preprocessor/programTransformation.C file):

	  ArrayStatementTraversal::ArrayStatementTraversal ( SgProject & inputProject )
               #ifdef __GNUC__
                  : AST_Rewrite::RewriteTreeTraversal<
                         ProgramTransformationInheritedAttributeType,
                         ProgramTransformationSynthesizedAttributeType>::RewriteTreeTraversal(project)
               #else
                  : RewriteTreeTraversal(project)
               #endif

	* Fix SUN vs. LINUX syntax for autoconf
	  In purify options for ROSE/config/support-purify.m4 the
	    following syntax was changed and comment added:
	
	    # Can't use "$(xxx)" syntax since it only works when build proecess is run on SUNs
            # Linux requires a different syntax: "$xxx" instead.
            # CCLD="$(AUX_LINKER) $(CXX)"
            # CXXLD="$(AUX_LINKER) $(CXX)"
              CCLD="$AUX_LINKER $CXX"
              CXXLD="$AUX_LINKER $CXX"

	* Phase out and remove 3 year old version of A++/P++ preprocessor
	  (A++P++Prerocessor1999).  I have removed it's use in the
	  ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/Makefile.am and in the
	  ROSE/configure.in file.

	* Added configuration support for Insure++ (similar but different
	  to Purify) source code error analysis compiler based tool.
	  See ROSE/configure --help for option details.

	* Fixed use of "make install" within configuration, removed
	  ROSE/include directory and placed header files in ROSE/src
	  (with their source files).

	* Removed references to STL-link in configuration files and
	  Makefile.am (in numerous directories).  ROSE now relies upon
	  the C++ compiler to provide an implementation of STL (cutting
	  ties to the SUN 4.2 compiler upon which SAGE II was so closely
	  tied). So "make dist" now works in addition to "make distcheck"
          which always worked.

	* Fixed use of __WIN32__ in EDG/src/basics.h to use not define it
	  as "0" and then check for definition using "#ifdef" instead of
	  "#if" (appears to be a bug in EDG source code). This fix
	  effected sage_cfe.C and sage_gen_be.C files as well.	

	* Fixed bugs in QueryLibs (some new libs might have been added
	  since the last checkin).  At some point all these libraries
	  should be combined into a single general Query library.
	  The design of the Query library mechanism needs to be reviewed.

	* Modified new mechanism for storing preprocessor control
	  declarations and comments in the AST. Removed mechanism to
	  remove comments once they were unparsed since this caused
	  side-effects in the unparser (problematic semantics for the
	  SgNode::unparseToString() member function).

	* Fixed ROSE to work with the SUN 5.2 C++ compiler.  However, the most
	  recient update to ROSE resulted in new code that does not
	  compile with the SUN 5.2 compiler.  This will be fixed in
	  subsequent checkins once all the developers are synched up.

	* Added InheritedAttributeBaseClass to simplify how the source
	  code position can be easily be communicated through the
	  inherited attribute within a tree traversal.  This might
	  result in a collection of similar mechanisms to use in the
	  construction of inherited attributes generally within the tree
	  traversal mechanism.

          ********* ERRORS *********

	
2002-10-16 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.9a 

	* Added attribute mechanism 
	  
	  The attribute mechanism allows to store data in the AST at each
	  node. This data can be used by different AST traversals. The
	  mechanism is designed such that it allows to combine data from
	  different traversals. In difference to inherited and synthesized
	  attributes which are copied by value and not attached to AST
	  nodes the AstAttributes are objects and pointers to them are
	  stored in the AST.  An attribute class must inherit from class
	  AstAttribute. When a PDF file is generated it shows the values 
	  of ast-attributes if the virtual toString method is implemented.
	  AstAttributes (and its values) are shown in blue in PDF files.
	
	  You can add/replace/remove/set and access an arbitrary number of attributes 
	  at any SgNode. Attributes are accessed by name (using string).
	  When you include Cxx_Grammar.h AstAttribute and AstAttributeMechanism
	  are defined.

          example:                TestAstAttribute* myAttribute = new TestAstAttribute();
          to add an attribute:    node->attribute.add("test",myAttribute);
	  to access an attribute: node->attribute["test"];

	  - refer to AstProcessing/AstAttributeMechanism
	         and MSTL/AttributeMechanism.h for the interface)
	  - every SgNode has now a data member "attribute" of type AstAttributeMechanism
	  - class AttributeMechanism added to MSTL
	  - class AstAttributeMechanism added to AstProcessing
	  - class AstAttribute added to AstProcessing
	* added AstTextAttributesHandling.[hC]
	  - this class is used in simple tests only in this version for showing
	    how and where ast-attributes are represented in PDF files.
	
	* added operator << for SgName (as string with quotes);
	  - all SgNames are now visable as strings in the PDF output

2002-10-01 Markus Kowarschik: Version 0.5.8d
        * Added an alternative way of handling preprocessor directives;
          they are now attached to located nodes in the AST. This new
          way is turned on/off by setting the macro
          USE_OLD_MECHANISM_OF_HANDLING_PREPROCESSING_INFO
          to 0/1, respectively. See the comment in the beginning of
          SAGE/attachPreprocessingInfo.C for further details.

2002-10-01 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.8c
	* bugfix: removed endl from some RTI information
	* added traverseWithinFile to Sg*Processing classes.
	  - the traversal can be started from any File node
	* PDF file generation:
	  - all pointers in the text page that refer to an existing node
	    in the AST are now PDF-page-links (can be clicked to get to the
	    corresponding page).
	  - added AstNodeVisitMapping to AstProcessingLib (used by PDF generation)

2002-09-23 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.8b
	* Added a tree traversal to ROSETTA
	  - used this traversal to generate code for runtime information (RTI) of an object
	    (this information is used in the PDF generation - it is not part of the C++ RTTI information)
	  - used this traversal to print a grammar.tex file that includes all information
	    regarding type hierarchy and traversal order for each node
	    (this information will be used in a documentation file later)
	    (it also documents "problematic AST nodes")
	* rewrote several functions in ROSETTA to use string instead of char*
	* Added new library AstProcessingLib (libastprocessing.a)
	  - AstPDFGeneration: creates a PDF file for any AST (and any subtree in an AST)
	  - AstStatistics (counts number of nodes in an AST)
	* Added new library MSTL (mstl.a)
	  - this is work in progress - it is used by AstProcessingLib.
	* Fixed bug in traverseInputFiles
	* added msDevelopment directory

2002-06-5 Dan Quinlan: Version 0.5.8a
	* Added most sophisticated preprocessor to date; the A++/P++ Preprocessor.
	  Located in ROSE/A++P++Preprocessor directory.  This preprocessor implements
	  lower level optimized code in substitutuion of array class code within 
	  applications.  This also implements the scalar indexing transformations, 
	  except that this transformation is not finished.  The current state of the 
	  proeprocessor is that it is being fixed to handle multiple transformations.
	  Since this is not finished the preprocessor does not work, except on the 
	  provided example problem.  I will fix this soon, but this at least gets the
	  A++/P++ preprocessor into the repository.  The A++P++Preprocessor/docs directory
	  included a document that has many examples (from before I added the second 
	  transformation, when the preprocessor was working quite well).  Current work 
	  by Sunjeev will add blocking and some simple cache-based options to the loop 
	  dependent transformation.

	* Added Babel Preprocessor (ROSE/BabelPreprocessor):
	  This preprocessor builds SIDL interface descriptions from C++ header files.
	  This is the first start at a more general preprocessor which woudl also implement
	  the connection between a targeted C++ library and the code generated by Babel
	  from the SIDL input interface description.

	* Added DataStructurePreprocessor (ROSE/DataStructurePreprocessor directory):
	  This preprocessor traverses C data structures and generates C++ classes 
	  associated with them.  The goal here is to automate the connection of ROSE to
	  language front-ends by an analysis of the data structures they use to represent
	  their AST internally.  We will see if this works, at the moment the preprocessor
	  has been attempted using a number of techniques, the most sucessful technique 
	  so far has been to break the complex queries into generic subqueries that are
	  placed into the QueryLib libraries.  At present only a few of the required queries
	  to support the DataStructurePreprocessor are implemented.  This work is also 
	  unfinished.

	* Added utility directory (ROSE/util) to place functions and mechanisms that are
	  common to use in both ROSETTA, ROSE, and preprocessors built using ROSE.

	* Numerous places (too many to list) where "char*" was used previously now use 
	  the string class and its member functions.

	* The AST rewrite mechanisms that are implemented in the AST nodes currently call 
	  code that has been isolated into the SAGE directory (files: generateAST.C,
	  grammarBaseClass.C, insert.C, and stripWrapper.C).  This is done to avoid the
	  specification of code that is (or was) changing often, into the ROSETTA code
	  generation step.  At some point this code will be placed into the steps that
	  generate code (e.g. SAGE III) from the specification of the C++ grammar that
	  ROSETTA uses.  This does not imply that the current setup should not work with
	  higher-level grammars, once that work is finished.

	* Added Query libraries (ROSE/QueryLibs directory):
	     Separate libraries support general queries that return lists of:
	        numbers, strings, boolean values, and SgNode pointers.  The example
	     preprocessors use these query libraries to implement nested queries that
	     defile larger application specific queries. 
	     Checking in these Query libraries allows us to begin the process of
	     defining a more complete mechanism that would implement all possible
	     queries. Can we define a mechanism by which ROSE could automate this?

	* A base class that simplifies the specification of synthesized attributes placed into
	  ROSE/src/synthesizedAttributeBaseClass.h and implemented in 
	  ROSE/src/synthesizedAttributeBaseClass.C.  This base class is used for the synthesized 
	  attributes defined in the A++P++Preprocessor (actually there is a hierarchy of classes
	  in the A++P++Preprocessor which implement the synthesized attributes, with the 
	  SynthesizedAttributeBaseClass as the root of all of them).
	
	* Added SgVariableDefinition::get_type() member function definition to 
	  ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar/Statement.code

	* Fixed redundent addition of parameters to function type argument list
	  (fixed in sage_gen_be.C, marked "DQ (5/11/2002)")

	* Fixed some minor bugs in the unparser.  Expanded functionality of 
          unparseToString() member function.

	* Added first pass at documentation for ROSE to ROSE/docs/ROSE/manual.tex.  
	  This is not finished.

	* Fixed bug in config/choose-backend-compiler.m4 to permit use of g++ with 
	  version 3.0.3 of the compiler.

	* Removed the compilation and testing of the ROSE/TransformationSpecification directory.
	  This directory will be removed at some point.  The preprocessors that where there are 
	  no better represented in the different A++P++Preprocessor, DataStructurePreprocessor,
	  and BabelPreprocessor directories.

	* Fixed several minor bugs in ROSETTA.

	* Fixed minor bugs in EDG front-end (Connection to SAGE).

	* Fixed several configuration bugs that were anoying.  Make clean now does a more robust job.
	  Dependencies between files required for force compilation are now better represented in the 
	  Makefile.am files in most directories.

	* Added more material to the ROSE/TODO file.  This should be merged with the other TODO files
	  before we get too many of them.

	* Added features to ROSE/src/pdf_ast.C to output more data about the AST 
	  in the pdf format.

	* Added many new files in this checkin (I've listed these since it has been so long 
	  since my last checkin):

2002-05-07 Boyana Norris: Version 0.5.7a 

        * Fixed bug with variable declarations with embedded enum declaration
	  by adding p_embedded flag to SgEnumDeclaration. The flag is set in
          the EDG to Sage 3 translation in EDG/src/sage_gen_be.C only 
          when the enum declaration is embedded in a variable declaration.
          The ROSETTA/src/statement.C was modified to include the new flag in
          the SgEnumDeclaration class, and ROSE/src/unparser/unparse_stmt.C 
	  was modified to unparse the enum declaration when the flag is set, 
	  and then unset the flag.

2002-04-30 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.7

	* Implemented new version of AST traversal. The size of the
 	  templated class/functions is now independent of the number of
 	  classes implementing the AST.  The two old implementations
 	  (object-oriented and template version) are obsolete.
	  This new version combines aspects of both and is supported by
 	  new generated AST node access methods. method traverse is no longer
 	  overloaded (was overloaded for each class)
	* Added code to ROSETTA to generate a method for each node which
 	  returns an AST successor container.  - we now have containers of
 	  *pointers* to all nodes in the AST! This gives us a uniform access
 	  method for any node in the AST.
	* Synthesized Attributes of successors are stored in a Container
 	  and passed to the parent node. This Container can be used in the
 	  evaluateSynthesizedAttribute method. It presents synAttributes of
 	  AST nodes that contain STL Containers in the *same* way as nodes
 	  that have successors of different type.  This concept relies on
 	  the fact that for every node in the AST it holds that it either
 	  has single successors or a container but not both (template nodes
 	  do not conform yet).
	* Added four new interfaces+implementation for traversal and
 	  evaluation of attributes:
	  - TopDownBottomUpProcessing (inherited and synthesized attributes)
	  - TopDownProcessing (only inherited attributes)
	  - BottomUpProcessing (only synthesized attributes)
	  - SimpleProcessing (only visit, no inherited or synthesized attributes)
	  : note that traverse, evaluateInheritedAttribute, 
	    evaluateSynthesizedAttribute, visit, have different parameterlists
 	    in the respective class
	  : there are no function pointers any more. These interfaces require
 	    pure virtual functions to be implemented by the user (instead of
 	    passing function pointers as in our previous version).
	  : the interfaces require 2,1, or 0 template parameters. The interfaces
 	    are designed to be as slim as possible.
	* Added code generation for names (strings) of variants
	* Added generation of method string get_variantName(unsigned int v);
 	  to all processing interfaces
	* Added DOT file generation of tree traversal trace to new traverse
 	  function.
	* Removed the clear flag from the public interface of the traversal.
 	  This is now handled internally and the user does not need to take
 	  care of it anymore.
	* Fixed problem with SgInitialization nodes in treeTraversal
	* Adepted evaluation scheme (=tree traversal node order) 
          (but note: types are not traversed yet)
	* modified TransformationSpecification/example8.C to use new AST
 	  processing interfaces.
	* added file ROSETTA/Grammar/treeTraversalImplementation.code 
	  (new traversal function)

2002-02-21 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.6b
	* Adepted existing Attributes and AttributeLists to be used at any AST node.
	* Rewrote PRAGMA handling routines to deal with the adepted attributes (the attributes are
	  used internally by ROSE to deal with PRAGMAs).
	
2002-02-12 Dan Quinlan: Version 0.5.6a
	* This version checks in the new string mechanisms and interfaces.  AST fragments
	  can be generated from strings, strings can be generated from AST fragements, and the
	  global tree traversal (still with only a low level interface) all implemented.

	* Added mechanism to generate AST fragments directly from strings (this mechanism 
	  reorganized the code that implemented the previous mechsnaism and provides a simple
	  interface.

	* Functions added within the SgNode to control the addition of new code using strings include:
	  appendSourceCode, prependSourceCode, replaceSourceCode, insertSourceCode member functions.
	  The "insertSouceCode" member function operates only on the global scope and on basicBlocks
	  and can add code to the top or botom (before a return statment if it exists) of a basic block.

	* Added mechanism to generate strings from ASTs.  This mechanism wraps the existing
	  unparser (the unparser in ROSE/src/unparse) so that it can be called on subgraphs of the
	  AST.  This us useful in conjunction with the mechanism to generate AST framenets directly 
	  from strings.

	* Fixed makefile dependence within ROSE/ROSETTA/src on *.code files in 
	  ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar directory.

	* Fixed bug that prevented the replacementSourceString function from working properly.
	  Traversal of lists in global tree traversal is replaced with a trversal of a copy of the list
	  so that any modification of the list (addition and/or deletion of elements in the STL list)
	  does not effect the traveral of the list elements by the parent node.  

	* grammar.C was modified to add copyEdit of the $CLASSNAME into the strings generated within the
	  Grammar::addNewDataMemberToVisit() function.   Need to talk to Markus to make sure that there is
	  not a better way to introduce this change to add substitution of $TYPENAME.

	* Makefile.am was modified to add the stamp-h.in and stamp-h1.in files to the distribution
	  (not sure how this ever worked before now).
	
2002-02-11 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.5c
	* fixed memory handling bug in/with Grammar::buildPrototypeForNode which caused
	  CxxGrammarMetaProgram not to terminate on Linux

2002-02-07 Markus Schordan: Version 0.5.5b
	* added new variant
	  naming scheme: V_<Classname>; can be accessed using variantT()
	  the enums and the implementing code are now generated automatically for every class
	* modified treeTraversal:
 	  - to traverse the AST as a tree (rather than a graph as it was before, about 50 changes in *.code files)
	  - to return a vector of snthesized attribute values of the AST subtree 
	    (the assembly function is now invoked only once
	    per subtree (instead of being invoked for each successor once))
	    this gives us a higher flexibility in defining semantic actions
	  - changed the interface of the assembly function to allow access to the node 'node' directly
	* added new enums to allow to access the synthesized attribute values of AST subtrees by name
	  - nameingscheme: <Classname>_<Membervariablename>
	    the enum is generated automatically for any membervariable that is traversed in the tree traversal
	* fixed problems in makefiles to handle roseString in ROSETTA

2002-01-17 Dan Quinlan
	* Fixed configuration to use new version 2.52 of Autoconf.
	* reduced the number of configure calls to 1 (plus BenchMarkBase).
	* Cleaned up directories removing unused files.
	* Configuration is now simpler and faster (and consistant with A++/P++ project).
	* ROSE now has a single config.h file (rather than 4 which was problematic previously).
	
2001-12-20 Dan Quinlan
	* Updated ROSE to use automake 1.5 and autoconf 2.52.
	  The process involved:
	     1) using autoupdate on all the configure.in files.
	     2) changing all the "dnl" references in the configure.in files to "#".
	     3) using AC_PROG_C and AC_PROG_CXX after selecting the C and C++ compilers based 
	        on the operating system (this allowed autoconf to set the $objext variable.
	     4) Commented out use of POP_LANG (with no corresponding PUSH_LANG) in EDG/configure.in
	     5) Fixed bug in EDG where "#ifdef" was used in a few places instead of "#if" (which was 
	        properly used all other places).  This was a bug because the new automake builds the
	        the config.h differently than the older automake (version 1.4) and uses the acconfig.h
	        files (the way the older automake should have, but didn't) and causes several entries 
	        of the sort:
                     #define STANDALONE_SAGE_GEN_BE 0
	        which when tested with #ifdef is TRUE, even though the author clearly ment it to 
	        be #if which would be false.  This caused hundreds of multiply defined variables because the lead to
	        "EXTERN" being defined to be "/* empty */" instead of "extern".  The following comment
	        marks the locations of where this was fixed in about 4 files (and one header file):
                /* DQ (12/20/2001) must use "if" can't use "ifdef" below since it is set by "#define STANDALONE_SAGE_GEN_BE 0" */
	        This is the first bug I have found to be clearly a bug in the EDG code (it is also in 
	        more recent versions of EDG!).
	     6) Remove old "missing" files so that the build scripts (which call automake with the "-a" option) will
	        place the newer updated versions of the "missing" file into the development directory (source directory).

          A difference between the new automake and the older autoconf is that not being able to read the Makefile.in files in any
	  directory seems to be a fatal error (output of autoconf 2.13):
                 updating cache ./config.cache

                 config.status: error: cannot find input file: dqDevelopmentDirectory/Makefile.in
                 gmake: *** [distcheck] Error 1

	Essentially, we should configure everywhere and use conditional compilation to compile in the compile tree.

2001-12-18 Dan Quinlan
	* Fixed bugs that prevented full tests of A++ source and A++ example code on LINUX (using g++ backend) 
	  and SUN (using Sun CC backend). Correct handling of bool was required.
	* Added fixes to Query mechanism (not yet using Markus's global tree traversal).
	* Added current work on A++/P++ preprocessor (plus examples of other queries).  This is 
	  not yet tested within the "make check" tests.
	* Placed configure.in source specific to setting up different back-end C++ compilers into
	  three different macros (this reorganized some of Bobby's macros).
	* Added an autoconf macro to allow for the selection of alternative back-end C++ compilers
	  (the default is to use the compiler that is selected for the compilation of ROSE source code).
                --with-alternate-backend-C++-compiler=<compiler name>
	* checks have confirmed that if KCC is used as the C compiler then the AC_SIZEOF_TYPE macro returns zero,
	  but if the default C compiler is used then the size of all tyes appear to be correct.
	  So don't use KCC as the C compiler!
	* Fixed numerous portability problems with the use of KCC (but still not finished), so KCC does not
	  currently work to compile ROSE (ROSE will compile, but some applications will not link yet).
	
2001-12-14 Markus Schordan 0.5.4b
	* fixed a bug in the dot-generation code
	
2001-12-14 Markus Schordan
	Checked in version 0.5.4
	* added DOT-file generation for a visualization of a trace of any tree traversal (query)
	* added option "rose:dot" to command line interface
	* altered the tree traversal to ensure no node is revisited during traversal
	  (the only remaining case is: SgFunctionDefinition)
	* fixed bug in SAGE3: file_info was wrong in SgExpressionRoot
	* fixed bug in EDG-SAGE connection: file_info was not properly initialized for
	  SgFunctionCallExp
	
2001-12-04 Bobby Philip
	Checked in version 0.5.3
	* shell script config/create_system_headers automatically processes compiler
	  specific headers and places them in a subdirectory ROSE/{CompilerName}_HEADERS
	  This takes care of the problem with the include_next preprocessor directive
	* m4 script config/compiler-defs.m4 automatically determines preprocessor macro
	  definitions that the compiler makes and writes a string to config.h
	* shell script config/dirincludes creates a string that is nothing but the -I options
	  for the subdirectories of ROSE/{CompilerName}_HEADERS where compiler specific headers
	  are stored. 
	* fixed test codes in TESTS/CompileTests to not rely on bool to be defined
	* fixed Query.{C, h} and related files to allow compilation with g++
	
2001-11-19 Bobby Philip
	Checked in version 0.5.2b
	* Ensured RoseString or STL string class can be used without conflicts
	* Removed all use of RoseString explicitly
	* Ensured TransformationSpecification/example7.C compiles with g++
	* Modified preproc.lex to ensure ANSI conformance for declaration of yywrap() fn
	* Ensured ROSE compiles on Linux with g++
	* Added function in ROSETTA/Grammar/Support.code to strip ROSE specific arguments from command line
	* Modified function compileOutput (4 versions) in ROSETTA/Grammar/Support.code to take compiler name
	
2001-11-11 Dan Quinlan
	Checked in version 0.5.2a
	* Moved query mechanism source for from development location (ROSE/TransformationSpecification)
	  to the ROSE/src directory.
	* Implemented mechanism for applications to communicate information to the preprocessors built using ROSE.
	  This mechanism is demonstrated within the new example A++ preprocessor (still in development).
	* This version includes the newest (unfinished) version of the A++ preprocessor (located in
	  ROSE/TransformationSpecification (the development directory for transformation mechanisms)).
	* Fixed ifdef which comments out the roseString.C source code in case STL_STRING_IS_BROKEN is defined
	* Fixed configuration (configure.in) to remove the "ROSE/$(CXX_TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY_PATH)" directory built
	  after configure tests for STL.
	* Moved older version of A++Preprocessor from ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor to 
	  ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor1999 and placed the newest version of the A++ preprocessor into
	  the ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor directory.  old files were removed from the old directory
	  and added (via cvs add) to the new directory location (ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor1999).
	* Added use of -I$(top_srcdir)/src to INCLUDES variable in numerous Makefile.am files so that 
	  ROSE header files could be located into the ROSE/src directory.  This prepares the configurations 
	  system to have all header files presently in ROSE/include moved to ROSE/src (where the really
	  should be located).
	* acmacros directory has been tared up and placed into the CVS repository.  This directory is 
	  normally checked out from a secondary location (maintained by Brian Gunney). This location is not
	  uniformally available to those doing development work on ROSE.  Future version of ROSE will
	  automatically use the acmacros.tar.gz when the acmacros cvs repository is unavailable.

2001-10-30 Markus Schordan
	Checked in version 0.5.1b
	rewrote lexfile and parts of the unparser to cope with combinations of macros/comments/linkage specifications
	in C++ files and provide more precise information for the backend (unparser).
	rewrote lexfile, using 5 instead of 3 explicite states
        * added column information to preprocessingInfo and changed interface of class preprocessingInfo accordingly
        * changed line_no for comment and macro from last line to first line 
	* changed interface of the lexer. The enum DirectiveType is now recognized during scanning of C++ files
	* added c comments in macrolines (they are recognized and included in the macro string; this way we are
	able to deal with macros that include comments that span several lines of code)
	* cpp comments spanning multiple lines using '\'.
	* c comments in macrolines spanning multiple lines using '\'.
	* added nesting of c/c++ linkage specifications
	* strings are explicitely recognized to handle problems with start/end
	  of comment syntax within strings (\" within strings is recognized)
	* extended enum DirectiveType to cope with error and nested linkagespecifications
	* adapted code in SAGE/rose_attributes_list.[hC] and ROSE/src/unparser.[hC] to deal with new interfaces.
	  removed all the old and obsolete functions.	

2001-10-22 Bobby Philip (rtag 0.5.1a by DQ 2001-11-30)
        Checked in all changes to date
        Fixed bug in configure which incorrectly passed wrong flags to configure ROSETTA
	Removed nested classes based implementation of ROSETTA and replaced it with a standard class implementation
	Fixed bugs in ROSE that resulting in failing to compile with g++, now all of ROSE compiles
	with g++ but make check fails with g++.
	Rewrote ROSETTA classes to use STL lists instead of the list class defined in tlist.h and ensured that the
	ROSETTA/src/Cxx_Grammar.* files are identical (modulo expected changes) to the original generated files
        Fixed bugs in ROSETTA/Grammar/*.code files that related to setting STL lists to NULL
	Moved a lot of string manipulation functions from the Grammar class to the GrammarString class
	Fixed a lot of memory leaks related to string manipulation (there are many still!)
	Moved ROSE/src/ListT directory to ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor and ensured that this list
	class is only used there.
	removed ROSE/src/postprocess* files
	
2001-10-17 Dan Quinlan
	Checked in version 0.5.0c

	Fixed problem with two versions of lex.yy.c (one in the source tree and one in the compile tree).
	Now we call the file generated by lex (from preproc.lex) preproc.C and we place that file into the
	distribution so that users don't have to directly use lex.  Since flex generates ANSI C code we use
	flex whenever flex is available (over that of lex), specifically we use the AM_PROG_LEX macro to
	control what version of lex we use (gnu flex or lex).  This sets $LEX and $LEXLIB in the makefiles
	(since we call AC_SUBST in the configure.in file after calling AM_PROG_LEX (for both variables).
	We set LEXLIB = -ll for now since we don't have our own yywrap defined (Markus will fix this in the
	lex file).  -ll seems to work with both lex and flex.  Flex is required for compilation with gcc
	(since it requires ANSI C and it would be too difficult to find the K&R switch for each C compier
	(if it even existed)).  It is only a developer issue if lex or flex is used, flex is prefered and
	appears to be more portable.

	Also fixed use of non_X_Symbol and X_Symbol (which I had gotten backwards in the 
	ROSE/ROSETTA/src/symbol.C file).

	Also fixed the number of command line options added to the command line for EDG (was 24, but 
	only 18 were used (a minor detail).  Note that present -D options added to EDG command line
	are specific to use with SUN system header files. This has to be made more flexible in the 
	near future.

2001-10-17 Dan Quinlan (morning)
	Checked in version 0.5.0b
	
2001-10-15 Dan Quinlan
	Fix bugs in EDG/SAGE interface:
	   * fileInfo object used in building break within a default case of a switch statement is built using data (seq == 0)
	     which indicates a special meaning (in this case that the break was not a part of the default in the original source code).
	     In this case we don't output the break into the SAGE 3 AST.
	   * The SgSwitchStatement was being built with the fileInfo object from the expression associated with the condition (??).
  	     This expression does not always have a valid fileInfo object (because the seq = 0) (which means something special in 
	     EDG land (see il_def.h). The source location is now taken directly from the input statement (which makes more sense anyway).
	   * Numerous other small bugfixes that were associated with bad source location information in the AST.
        Fix to unparser:
	   * Numerous fixes to the unparser have been done.  Mostly in connection with the interleaved unparsing of the strings 
	     stripped out by the lax/yacc preprocessing of each source file. This part of the unparser has been rewritten from scratch
	     (too many work arounds of work around in the older version).  As a result the newer version is simpler and much shorter.
	     However, the newer version required that numberous details be fixed in the EDG/SAGE interface (hence the work arounds
	     in the older version).
           * Note that the name of the class is allowed to be empty in the case of: typedef struct <no tag required here> { int x; } y;
	   * Made the assertion of line number > 0 be skipped for fileInfo objects with the filename == "default_file_name"
	   * Force call to set_col to use a parameter greater than or equal to zero (when it is reset in hte unparser)
	Fix to A++ preprocessor:
	   * forced all new statements associated with a transformation to have a fileInfo object with the filename 
	     set to "default_file_name".  Ultimately we would like a better way to make statements that have been added
	     as part of a transformation.
	Fix to portability of lex files:
	   * Modified ROSE/src/Makefile.am to separate the make rule specific to the generation of the preproc.o file
	     from the preproc.lex file.  Now the lex file is used only if the preproc.lex file is modified else we
	     use the lex.yy.c file directly.  The lex.yy.c file is also now placed into the distribution.  We have 
	     to make sure that within the development of ROSE that we use a version of lex that will generate a 
	     sufficently portable .c file from a .lex file.

2001-10-12 Dan Quinlan
	Fixed ROSE/ROSETTA/ROSE_CxxGrammar.cfg (Doxygen input file) to reflect new location of Cxx_Grammar.h and Cxx_Grammar.C.
	Also updated ROSE/ROSETTA/Makefile.am to build the ../docs/CxxGrammar since Doxygen can't build more than a single
	directory level associated with placement of its output files (a Doxygen bug, since the fix is simple!).
	
2001-10-09 Bobby Philip
	Removed files that were old and confusing to first time users of ROSE, added some files into different
	locations to improve directory structure of ROSE.  Modified autoconf/automake files as required to
	make new directory structure work.  Some minor modifications may yet remain.

********* WARNINGS *********
********* ERRORS *********

2001-10-01 Markus Kowarschik
	There are two different tree traversal mechanisms available now.
	A describtion of how these mechanisms work can be found in the
	file ROSETTA/treeTraversal.txt. A simple example showing how each
	of these mechanisms is used can be found in src/rose_treeTrav_MK.C.

2001-09-05 Markus Kowarschik
	Unified the introduction of data members and function members (ROSETTA).
	The member function of class Terminal now has (among others) three boolean parameters
	which determine
	- if the corresponding data member is to become a constructor parameter
	- if the corresponding access functions are to be created
	- if the data member is to be traversed during a tree traversal

2001-09-05 Dan Quinlan
	Added initial work on Query mechanism plus some examples.
	Moved STL to STL-1995 and we now use STL-link as a link to whichever version of STL is in use.
	Tried to use the newest version of STL from SGI, and STLPort (neither work for Sun C++ 4.2 compiler.
	Fixed configuation issues associated with C code having the STL path specified (not done now).
	Continued adding multiple file compilation support for preprocessors build using ROSE (still incomplete).
	Tested ROSE/src/rose example preprocessor against PetSc, worked on level 4, but not on level 5, which 
	means that the unparser fails to unparse the C code correctly :-(.

2001-08-27 Dan Quinlan
	Fixed configure script "makelinks" to build TESTS/PerformanceTests direcotry
	before cd'ing into it (since a freash checkout from CVS does not include this directory yet).
	
2001-08-27 DAN QUINLAN

	* FIXED TRANSFORMATION SPECIFICATION CODE TO HANDLE TRANSFORMATION
 	ON ANY TYPE OF STATEMENT (NOT EXPRESSIONS OR TYPES YET).

	* ADDED PREPEND, REPLACE, AND APPEND AS OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH
 	HOW A TRANSFORMATION IS ADDED TO THE APPLICATION PROGRAM'S AST
 	(THE MAIN AST).

	* FIXED CONFIGURATION TO MAKE THE PERL ENABLED TESTING FRAMEWORK
 	(PETF) OPTIONAL (DISTRIBUTION TESTS VIA THE DISTCHECK RULE WERE
 	FAILING).

	* ADDED FIRST VERSION OF QUERY MECHANISM TO THE TRANSFORMATION
 	SPECIFICATION (THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK HOWEVER), THE FILES ARE
 	QUERY.H AND QUERY.C IN THE ROSE/TransformationSpecification
 	directory.
	
2001-08-14  Markus Kowarschik (comments by Dan)
	Bugs fixed by Markus (he needs to comment on what is present in this checked in version of ROSE).
	Initial version of global tree traversal.
	Current version is: 0.4.9a
	
2001-08-10  Dan Quinlan
	This is the first checkin in a long time.  Markus also has to check work in and so I wanted to checkin
	things first plus get the "make distcheck" mechanism working for everyone else.  It seems to not work
	in the version of ROSE presently in the CVS repository.  This should simplify everyones work of making
	sure that their changes have not broken anything in ROSE.
	Numerous details are missing from the list below.  I have not checked in my own work frequently enough.
	A few of the things fixed in this version are:
      * Fixed DOXYGEN files so that Doxygen can be run from by make (but not run withouth explicitly specification).
      * Added (more) support for generation of grammars from class declarations.  Only simple stuff is working, and
	I forget if the output AST restructuring tool even compiles properly.
      * Finished first verion of transformation specification mechanism. (Only simple stuff works).
      * Fixed Makefile.am(s) so that "make dist" works correctly now.
      * Fixed Makefile.am(s) so that "make distcheck" works correctly now.

2001-06-01 through 2001-08-10  Dan Quinlan
	ChangeLog was not updated, I think there was nothing checked in since Markus and I were writing papers
	and I was away at numerous conferences.  A lot of work was done, but not checked in.  Markus
	has been working on the global tree traveral support (to be generated by ROSETTA) and he has
	fixed numerous bugs which he has documented outside of this file).  Dan has been working on the 
	generation of grammars from the class declarations and the specification of transformations.
	
2001-05-30  Dan Quinlan
	Changed default in EDG to permit compiling exceptions. Fixed one of several bugs in the 
	AST restructuring tool to handle exceptions. There is still more left to fix. In the case where
	it is fixed in the AST restructuring tool (generated SAGE code), the unparser does not 
	generated the corect code.  dqDevelopmentDirectory/test2001_29.C demonstrates the error.
	
2001-05-29  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed bug in Node::setTreeNodeAsTouched() in the files used to generate the AST restructuring Tools
	for each grammar.  The bug was noticed by Markus K.
	
2001-05-23  Dan Quinlan
	Checked in Markus's additions for ROSE/src/pdf_ast.C.
	Erin discovered that catch and try statements don't work in EDG and once we turned 
	on the exception handling in EDG we discovered that they don't work in SAGE II.  
	This is an STL issue that is not implemented. There is a note about this in the TODO list.
	
2001-05-08  Dan Quinlan
	Made final fixes to configuration and ran test with purify using Sun C++ 4.2 and KCC 3.4g.
	Fixed use of acmacros in ROSE/SAGE (previously not calling test for bool directly).
	Released version 0.4.8a (checked it into the CVS repository).

	KCC configure line tests:
	configure   --with-CC='KCC --c'
	            --with-CXX=KCC
	            --enable-dq-developer-tests 
	            --with-AxxPxx=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/A++P++Install 
	            --with-CXX_DEBUG='-g +K0 -k' 
	            --with-C_DEBUG='-g +K0 -k'
	
2001-05-07  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed bugs in sage_gen_be.C and the A++ specific grammar that were a problem for KCC with purify.
	This seems to fix all purify problems reported when using KCC on the Solaris platform.
	The final two bugs had to do with copying "char*" strings so that SAGE could have it's
	own copy and avoid using anything from EDG directly.
	
2001-05-06  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed unparser error that only appeared with the KCC compiler.  Modified in 
	modified_sage.C (for global functions) and unparse_stmt.C (for member functions) files.
	
          // Output of a Null string seems to be an problem with
          // some ostream implementations (KCC for example).
          #if 0
               if (do_unparse)
                    (*os) << tmp_name.str();
               if (tmp_name.str() != NULL)
                    chars_on_line += strlen(tmp_name.str()); 
          #else
            // This is a more consistant way to handle the NULL string case
               if (tmp_name.str() != NULL)
                  {
                    if (do_unparse)
                         (*os) << tmp_name.str();
                    chars_on_line += strlen(tmp_name.str());
                  }
          #endif

2001-05-05  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed asserts:
	    SgName X;
	    assert (X != NULL);
	This code caused the SgName constructor to be called with the value "NULL" and then
	called the operator!=().  This only appeared to happen with the KCC compiler and 
	not on the SUN CC 4.2 compiler.

2001-05-04  Dan Quinlan
	PORTABILITY ISSUE: Fixed bug in EDG/util/edg_prelink.c.
	    KCC header files don't specify "FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *mode);"
	correctly. To KCC "FILE*" is an int, or popen is defined to return an int at least.
	The following file demonstrates the problem:
	
2001-04-27  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed numerous minor bugs and fixed ArrayPreprocessor as an example preprocessor.
	Checked in version representing fixes before addressing portability issues.
	
2001-04-12  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed the generation of the array grammar from the C++ grammar, file: ArrayGrammarMetaProgram.C
	generates the array grammar (actually both the C++ grammar and the array grammar).
	More work is required to cause sage to process the file and suplement the array grammar
	with the member functions of the array class (this used to work, I'm just making it work
	under the newer versions of the code).
	
2001-04-10  Dan Quinlan
	Checked in a version just before noon to CVS. This version 0.4.6a passedall tests and was
	tagged using "cvs rtag ROSE-0-4-6a-release ROSE".

	This version also has preliminary support for the tree traversal code (setting of a "touched"
	flag in every node of the AST).  More work to do on automating the generation of code to do 
	the tree traversal.
	
2001-04-9  Dan Quinlan
	Added files for ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor.  This preprocessor is specific
	to A++.
	
2001-04-9  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed command line bug associated with previous addition. The SgFile object now saves 
	a reference to the argc and argv input to main.  These are modified by different phases
	of the command line processing (for ROSE, EDG, and for the final C++ compiler pass).

	Command line processing implementation note:
	ROSE options are stripped off by the ROSE option processing phase and EDG specific 
	options are stripped off by the EDG option processing phase. Each phase builds a 
	separate command line using the command line input to the ROSE preprocessor. Each 
	phase also adds some additional options to the separate command lines that each phase 
	constructs. Remaining options are passed on the compilation phase.
	
2001-04-8  Dan Quinlan
	Placed calls to generate EDG and SAGE AST's into the constructor for SgFile. The SgFile
	constructor is called by SgProject, this simplifies the design of prerocessors much 
	further than before.

	Expanded the features of the SgFile and SgProject objects within the ROSE grammars.
	This was done as part of the simplification of the interface of ROSE.  Several of the
	most top level EDG/SAGE functions (in EDG/src) now take SgFile objects (e.g. edg_main(),
	sage_back_end() and init_sage_cp_gen_be()). Copied ROSE/include/rose_attributes_list.h
 	to ROSE/SAGE/rose_attributes_list.h and ROSE/src/rose_attributes_list.C to
	ROSE/SAGE/rose_attributes_list.C (and removed these from their previous locations.
	This was done to place these lists where they were referenced now that they are stored
	(now that they are stored in the SgFile object).
	
2001-04-7  Dan Quinlan
	Simplified the construction of preprocessors (the default one "rose.C" built in ROSE/src).
	This is in preparation for a directory of preprocessors that demonstrate the use of
	ROSE to build multiple preprocessors. Checked in the results of this work this morning.

	Note: This has disabled the features specific to the array optimizations which have to 
	be added to the preprocessor located in the ROSE/ExamplePreprocessors/A++Preprocessor
	directory.
	
2001-04-6  Dan Quinlan
	Added
             AliasedDPtr.C                Array.C                                 DPtr.C \
             Face_inline.C                List.C                                  NormedFab.C \
             PArray.C                     SimpleDPtr.C                            tlist.C \
             ArithFab.C                   BaseFab.C                               FabArray.C \
             Geom_inline.C                ListOfReferenceCountedObjects.C         OrderedFab.C \
             Pointers.C                   Tuple.C \
	to the automake EXTRA_DIST in ROSE/TESTS/CompileTests/OvertureCode directory to fix 
	the execution of the "make distcheck" rule generated by automake.
	
2001-04-5  Dan Quinlan
	Added TESTS/CompileTests/OvertureCode direcotry.  Fixed bug in EDG/SAGE connection
	which prevented compilation of Overture code using ROSE.  Added OvertureBug_01.C to 
	OvertureCode direcotry to represent the fixed bug.  

	Added error checking to EDG/SAGE (sage_gen_be.C and sage_il_to_str.C) to check the
	value of the curr_source_sequence_entry pointer.  
             assert (curr_source_sequence_entry != NULL);
	I also had to disable a few of these asserts because of how the SAGE AST generation 
	is designed (or not designed) to walk off the end of the source sequence list.
	I wanted to assert that this pointer would never be NULL, but this is the stopping 
	criteria for the "for (;;)" loop in sage_process_file_scope_entities(SgGlobal& top).
	We need better stopping criteria so that we can universally assert that 
	curr_source_sequence_entry is not NULL.  My first fix caused infinite loops :-).

	Fixed up the tests run by "make check" and the configuration so that "make dist"
	runs properly.

	Removed numerous files from my development version (files not longer generated because 
	we properly use the -fourien flag to automake).  Getting ready for next big phase of work
 	on automated generation of support for the transformation specification mechanism.
	
2001-04-3  Dan Quinlan
	Added TESTS/CompileTests and TESTS/RunTests direcoties (or directories) of tests.

	Fixed the AM_CONDITIONAL in ROSE/configure.in to be correctly when we don't specify a
	path to the A++/P++ library.

2001-04-2  Dan Quinlan
	Reorganized the TESTS directory to divid it between two directories (CompileTests and RunTests).
	Finished on related bugs and errors in the distribution system using autoconf and automake.

2001-04-1  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed distributions built using "make dist" to work correctly.  Most tests
	are still using "-rose:test 6" (level 6 testing) because the translation from
	the SAGE AST to the higher level ASTs is not robust yet.

	NOTE: the use of "make distcheck" still fails, I think because configure requires the
	"--with-sla=/usr/casc/overture/local-sparc64-sun-solaris2.7" option.  The use of
	"make distcheck" assumes that "configure --srcdir=.. --prefix=$$dc_install_base"
	will correctly configure the distribution (not other options can be specified).

	Removed dependence upon the external use of SLA by including the sla.c and slaxx.C
	into the ROSE/src/command_line_options directory and puting the sla.h header file into
	the ROSE/include directory.  This simplifies the use of ROSE by removing the requirement of
	any options on the command-line for "configure" (which shoudl allow "make distcheck" to work.
	
2001-03-30  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed preprocessor built with ROSE to correctly do array transformations.
	
2001-03-25  Dan Quinlan
	Started fix for dypedeclarations asspocated with variable declarations arising from
	     struct tag { int x; } X;
  	This is currently unparsed as 
	     struct tag X;
	The type declaration is separated out and placed into the orphan list within each scope,
	but SAGE (and even EDG's unparser) ignores entries in this list and so the typedeclaration
	is not placed into the SAGE AST (or output using the EDG C++ unparser).  I want to checkin
	the current changes to CVS before continuing to work on this bug.  Currently now A++ code is
	effected by this problem.

	The first declaration mechanism within the EDG tree does not seem to work, though domain.C
	was able to turn it on at some point (I don't know how this mechanism works, since it does not
	seem to work the way it is supposed to).
	
2001-03-25  Dan Quinlan
	Added previously unimplemented pdf versions of code to EDG/src/displayTree.C
	Fixed numerous minor bugs in displayTree.C (added pdf version of walk list macro)

2001-03-24  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed typedefs of function and member function pointers.
	
2001-03-21  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed Makefile.am in ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory directory to avoid building anything when rose is made
	and added support to permit rose to be tested when "make check" is run.

2001-03-20  Dan Quinlan
	Added ROSE/TESTS and ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory directories.

2001-03-19  Dan Quinlan
	Wrote PDF display mechanism for EDG and SAGE ASTs (work great but still somewhat incomplete).
	EDG AST is traversed using the scopes instead of the source_sequence_lists.  Likely need both.

2001-03-10  Dan Quinlan
	Separated files associated with sage_gen_be.C (to make this file shorter and permit
	common parts to be used by displayTree.C).
	
2001-03-1  Dan Quinlan
	Changed version number to be consistant with previous work (0.3.9 was the last used (last year)).
	So I made the current version 0.4.1a.
	
2001-02-28  Dan Quinlan
	Added support for PDF files (part of AST generator (not finished))
	
2001-02-27  Brian T. N. Gunney  <gunney@cogneato.llnl.gov>

	* config/ROSE.m4: Fixed Dan's C and C++ specification macros so that
	the environment is checked if configure flags are not specified
	for compilers.

2001-02-27  Dan Quinlan
	* Finished first pass at support for extern "C" surrounding header files.
	Currently we limit the use of this approach to the following two cases:
             1) opening brace on the same line as the extern "C" modifier:
 	          extern "C" {
                  #include <filename>
                     }
             2) opening brace on the following line:
 	          extern "C"
                     {
                  #include <filename>
                     }
	In each case the closing brace is introduced AFTER the NEXT "#include<filename>" 
	directive. So a limitation that we place on the use of this technique is that it 
	must be done for each file separately. A more robust mechanism will likely be 
	implemented later. test2001_18.C currently is used to test this mechanism.

	* Commented out function invocation from member function pointer in 
	A++/src/array_src/lazyarray.C.  Built test code test2001_19.C to test this
	problem.  lazyarray.C can now be processed through ROSE and the output
	compiles properly (this code is not used in A++ anymore, be we will fix 
	it anyway (shortly)).

2001-02-26  Dan Quinlan
	*Fixed bug in the unparsing (unparse_exp.C) of the function pointer 
	used to call functions.
	
	*Fixed bug in construction of sage calsses from EDG (enumVal was not 
	being specified with a SgName using a value string).
	
2001-02-25  Dan Quinlan
	Added support for extern "C" (which is turned off in this version I'm checking in).
	This work is still incomplete.
	
2001-02-24  Dan Quinlan
	Added purify support for EDG directory.
	Fixed use of EDG with purify (it requires purify.h if purify is used at link time).
	Basically EDG supports only the purify API, and does not work well with the purify 
	used as a linker only.

	Added referenceCount variable to SgNode object.
	
2001-02-23  Brian T. N. Gunney  <gunney@cogneato.llnl.gov>

	* config/support-purify.m4: Added file with macros to support optional

2001-02-22  Dan Quinlan
	* Fixed numerous bugs represented in the first 13 test codes 
	(test2001_02.C - test2001_13.C in the ROSE/dqDevelopmentDirectory).
	17 of the 21 A++ C++ files presently compile in src/array_src.

	* extern "C" #include <filename.h> is still an issue.

	* Modified sage_gen_be to fix printing of type name for SgConstructorInitializer 
	objects when they appear in the return type (SgReturnType).

2001-02-22  Brian T. N. Gunney  <gunney@cogneato.llnl.gov>

	* build, EDG/build, ROSETTA/build, SAGE/build: Specify --foreign
	in automake to prevent the introduction of the GPL statement.

	* makelinks: Checkout or export acmacros if required.

	* distcheck: Working towards a distribution that will pass distcheck.
	Source code directories ok now.  EXAMPLES not fixed yet.  We have
	to make rose behave treat more compiler flags correctly first.

	* src/ListT: Made src/ListT automake-controlled to produce correct
	distribution.

2001-02-22  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed bug in the placement of the object file when using the compile tree
	separated from the source tree.

2001-02-21  Brian T. N. Gunney  <gunney@cogneato.llnl.gov>

	* SAGE: Added top level SAGE directory.  src/SAGE is now obsolete.
	Copied only required files from src/SAGE to SAGE.  The rest of the
	files are obsolete.

	* Configuration: Moved SAGE from src to the top level directory
	so other packages can view it as an independent package.

	* configure.in: Allow specifying A++P++ for testing.
	Specifying A++ alone is obsolete.

2001-02-18  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed bug in preproc.lex.
	Previously we had to have a space in all #include preprocessor statements.
	This is not required for many C and C++ compilers, so this is now fixed.

	// previous note added to the test2001_03.C file:
           Note: Must have space between the "include" and the "<filename>" substrings
                #include <stdlib.h>

	* Fixed bug in the printing of boolean values (used to be upper case and is not lower case).
	  This effects the printing of values like "true" and "false" (now a standard part of C++).

2001-02-17  Dan Quinlan
	*Fixed edg_main to return error level which is then used to conditionaly process
	phases after the edg front-end.  This simplifies development work of applications using ROSE.
	*Fixed another of the unparser bugs (test2001_02.C).

2001-02-12 Brian T.N. Gunney <gunneyb@llnl.gov>
	* configure.in: Support with-Axx flag.
	* EXAMPLES/Makefile.am: Pass Axx_INCLUDES environment to test script.
	* EXAMPLES/test1_script: Use environment variable Axx_INCLUDES.

2001-02-12 Brian T.N. Gunney <gunneyb@llnl.gov>
	* Configuration: Removed obsolete configure.in files.
	Changed generic PADRE_ macros and variables to generic
	BTNG_ variables, now that they are not maintained under
	PADRE anymore.  Removed obsolete generated EXAMPLES/aclocal.m4.
	* compiler-id.m4: Change compiler id strings so they are all
	standardized to lower case.
	* compiler-ar.m4: Defines macro to determine how to create
	static and dynamic libraries.

2001-02-09  Dan Quinlan
	*Fixed one of the unparser bugs (test2001_01.C).
	
2001-02-09 Brian T.N. Gunney <gunneyb@llnl.gov>
	* ROSETTA: Removed generated Cxx_Grammar.[Ch] files.
	They are now generated by a local rule in ROSETTA.
	Links are set up by config.status to create links to
	the generated Cxx_Grammar.[Ch] in the compile tree.
	* EDG: Dumped old configuration and replaced with one
	using automake.

2001-02-08 Brian T.N. Gunney <gunneyb@llnl.gov>
	* Configuration: Added use of acmacros.  Make check in EDG now
	runs make all first.

2001-02-05 Brian T.N. Gunney <gunneyb@llnl.gov>
	* Configuration: Overhauling configuration.  Some files added.
	Many obsoleted and removed.  Currently unstable.

2001-01  Dan Quinlan
	Checked in several months of changes to CVS repository.
	
2000-12  Dan Quinlan
	Added feature in ROSE preprocessors to permit the compiler to be called on 
	the unparsed output code after ROSE preprocessing (to be consistant with 
	the C or C++ compiler so that ROSE preprocessors act as a frontend for the 
	C or C++ compilers.
	
2000-11  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed preprocessors built by ROSE to use files consistant with with the way they are used by
	compilers so that autoconf projects can substitue the name of a ROSE preprocessor to 
	replace the name of the C or C++ compiler and test th use of ROSE.

2000-10  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed the commandline interface to be similar to KCC (somewhat) and provide multiple
	levels of testing internally.
	
2000-09  Dan Quinlan
	Fixed numerous minor erros in the unparsing to get back the simlarly formated
	output as input feature of the rose preprocessors.
	Command line processing now using SLA (Brian Gunney's work).

2000-07-26  Danny Thorne

   Put a bunch of new documentation in the preinit stage.  Fixed a couple
   miscellaneous bugs that I encountered along the way.  Deleted a bunch of 
   extraneous stuff that was left over from past experiments.  Surrounded most 
   preinit related IO with #if PREINIT_VERBOSE ... #endif.  Hence, 
   PREINIT_VERBOSE==FALSE will eliminate almost all output during the preinit 
   stage.  PREINIT_VERBOSE is currently defined at the top of sage_gen_be.C.

2000-07-24  Danny Thorne 

   I have almost decided on abandoning the SgTemplateInstantiation classes and 
   just using the existing SgClass classes to handle templates in SAGE/ROSE.  
   Currently I'm browsing EDG/src/templates.c and such in order to figure out 
   how to get the template parameter lists into SAGE.

   Spoke with Dan after lunch today.  He supports the idea of just using the
   SgClass classes instead of SgTemplateInstantiation classes.

   Trying to figure out how EDG does the substitution of template arguments for
   template parameters throughout the body of the template when it is 
   instantiated.  It seems to be happening during push_scope_full() in 
   scope_stk.c, but I can't figure out exactly how, yet.  Will need to modify 
   the way this works in order to be able to reverse the process within the 
   ROSE unparser.

2000-07-21  Danny Thorne 

   Fixed a memory management problem in the unparser.  At the end of unparser.C, 
   we were calling dir_list.deepClean() and then delete dir_list, but the 
   destructor for dir_list reproduces the call to dir_list.deepClean().  This 
   gives rise to an error in Purify, and I fixed it by just removing the 
   redundant call to dir_list.deepClean().  Now only the "delete dir_list" 
   remains.  Note, the same problem and fix exist for dir_listList, as well.
 
   Trying to figure out how to proceed with handling template instantiations in
   SAGE/ROSE.  I'm concerned about whether it is actually better to have 
   explicit SgTemplateInstantiation classes in SAGE or to just add some members 
   to the existing SgClass classes in order to represent template instantiations 
   that way.  It might be easier to handle template instantiations with SgClass 
   classes and just add some extra stuff.  In fact, I'm not sure what extra stuff 
   is even needed at this point.  We're storing the template args in the SgName 
   class.  We should probably store template parameters in the SgName class as 
   well.  Maybe there is nothing to motivate a SgTemplateInstantiation class.

   What's a "prototype instantiation of a class"? cf. class_decl.c, 
   decl_member_function(), and symbol_table.h, struct a_template_instance.

2000-07-20  Danny Thorne 

   Worked around my problems with STL and am successfully printing out the 
   template arguments into a comment from unparseClassDeclStmt().

2000-07-19  Danny Thorne

   Fixed the core dump when running ROSE on the STL sample code.  

   The problem was that in sage_gen_lvalue(), somehow sageExpr1 was NULL in a 
   call to the SgConditionalExp() constructor.  

   It was happening because, previous to the call to the constructor, I was
   checking if( sageExpr1 = NULL) when I should have been checking 
   if( sageExpr1 == NULL). Same problem for sageExpr2, by the way.

   Now everything is initialized on the first preinit pass in the STL code!
   That's with TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE == FALSE, by the way.

   With TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE == TRUE the preinit stage ends normally
   when no progress is made on the second pass, then SAGE core dumps in 
   sage_form_template_args() when assert(tap->variant.type->kind == 
   tk_ptr_to_member) fails.

   Fixed this by handling the case tap->variant.type->kind != tk_ptr_to_member
   seperately.  In the case that tap->variant.type->kind != tk_ptr_to_member,
   the call to sage_form_type() withing sage_form_template_args() doesn't
   need a non-NULL pointer to the class under which the current argument
   type is a member, so I just pass a NULL pointer to sage_form_type() in this
   case.  Now ROSE terminates normally with the STL code when 
   TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE == TRUE and the preinit stage is turned on.  
   Note that ROSE still core dumps on this STL code when 
   TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE == TRUE and the preinit stage is skipped.
   This is a milestone in the developement of the preinit stage.

   Attempting to arrange for the unparser to output the template args within
   a comment in the appropriate place.  Somehow, though, the template arg lists
   are always empty when encountered in the unparser.  I've verified that they
   are not empty in SAGE.

   I think we need to teach the SgName copy constructor to handle template args.

   Yes, that did it.  I added p_TemplateArgs = n.get_TemplateArgs() to
   
      $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name::$GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name(const $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name& n)

   and I added p_TemplateArgs = n1.get_TemplateArgs() to

      $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name&
      $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name::operator=(const $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_Name& n1)

   both of which are in ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar/Support.code.

   Now the TemplateArgs field remains non-empty when it is supposed to.

   Having trouble iterating through the list of arguments.  Technical difficulties
   with STL, I guess.  I seem to be doing it the same way that it's done in other
   places in unparse_stmt.C, but it's not working for me.

2000-07-11  Danny Thorne

   Trouble-shooting a problem in sage_form_template_args() where
   tap->variant.type->kind != tk_ptr_to_member.  See the comments in this function
   (it's in sage_il_to_str.C).

   Inserted code in sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity_check_types() and
   sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity_check() to output the filename and
   line number of the source entities associated with the IL entries. Also
   completed inserting code to output the name (source_corresp.name)
   associated with the IL entries.  Previously this was being done in only
   a selection of cases.  In fact, it is still the case that there are cases
   for which nothing at all is being output, but these correspond to the
   cases which are not yet implemented in the preinit stage.

   Did some miscellaneous, primarily cosmetic, editing in sage_gen_be.C.

   Note that I currently have END_PREINIT_ON_LACK_OF_PROGRESS turned on which means 
   that the preinit stage will terminate if the latest pass didn't result in 
   anything new being initialized from the previous pass.  This flag is near the 
   top of sage_gen_be.C along with another flag called MAX_PREINIT_PASSES which
   is currently set to 10.

   Did a CVS checkin.

2000-07-10  Danny Thorne
 
   The core dump was because one of my FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
   snippets had "&& FALSE" after it, so current_preinit_task_failed was not
   getting set to TRUE in that case.  I fixed that and now get multiple passes
   of the preinit stage, but no progress is being made after the first or
   second pass.

   Eliminated all the stuff in the preinit stage that tried explicitly to manage
   what order things get created in.  We shouldn't have to do that now that the
   current_preinit_task_failed mechanism is in place.

   Trying to debug a really unusual problem:  Upon return from sage_gen_type_reference()
   within sage_gen_name_reference(), several functions are removed from the bottom
   of the call stack.  This is really weird, and I don't yet have any ideas how
   to fix it.

   Finally fixed it like this: (Note that the FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
   section constitutes the fix, and the !FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
   section is what was there before.) 

      static void sage_gen_name_reference(char *entry, an_il_entry_kind kind )
      /* Routine to be called by the il_to_str routines to output a name.  */
      {
        a_SgDeclarationStatement_ptr * tmp =
          (Globals::nameReference) ? Globals::nameReference : &dummyDecl;
        Globals::nameReference = 0;

        /* Types get handled specially; everything else goes through the normal gen_name. */
        if (kind == iek_type) {
      #if FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES && /*TESTING=*/TRUE
          a_SgDeclarationStatement_ptr pre_tmp =
             sage_gen_type_reference((a_type_ptr)entry);
          if( preinit_pass && current_preinit_task_failed ) return;
          if( pre_tmp == NULL && tmp == Globals::nameReference )
          {
            //
            // [DT] 7/10/2000 -- NOTE: Assigning *tmp = NULL can give rise
            //      to a really flakey core dump when tmp == Globals::nameReference.
            //      Somehow it corrupts the stack.  In the debugger, it looks like
            //      several functions are mysteriously removed from the bottom of
            //      the call stack.  The consequences of this are not felt until
            //      later, several calls down in the stack from here.
            //
            //      So, anyway, if somehow sage_gen_type_reference() returns
            //      NULL without setting current_preinit_task_failed to TRUE,
            //      I'm just going to exit here before trying to assign
            //      *tmp = NULL in the case that tmp == Globals::nameReference
            //      to start with.
            //
            printf("\n\n\nsage_gen_be.C: sage_gen_name_reference() -- Unhandled condition.  Exiting.\n\n\n");
            exit(1);
          }
          *tmp = pre_tmp;
      #else /* !FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES */
          *tmp = sage_gen_type_reference((a_type_ptr)entry);
      #endif /* FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES */
        } else {
          // todo?
          gen_name((a_source_correspondence *)entry, kind,
                   (a_boolean)octl.force_qualified_name);
        }  /* if */
      }  /* sage_gen_name_reference */

   Evidently it was not a good thing to assign *tmp = NULL.

   Well, I've since found out that it's sometimes not good to assign even
   something non-NULL to *tmp.  The same flakey core dump associated with
   a corrupted stack can occur.

   Fixed it with this:

      #if 0
        a_SgDeclarationStatement_ptr * tmp =
          (Globals::nameReference) ? Globals::nameReference : &dummyDecl;
      #else
        a_SgDeclarationStatement_ptr * tmp = &dummyDecl;
      #endif

   Note that tmp actually is not useful in this routine at all.  It stores
   the return value from sage_gen_type_reference(), but it's never used
   after that.  I wonder what the SAGE developers had in mind for tmp here.

2000-07-8  Danny Thorne

   Finished introducing the current_preinit_task_failed mechanism
   in sage_gen_be.C.  Now I need to do it in sage_il_to_str.C.

   Finished sage_il_to_str.C also.  (It's shorter than sage_gen_be.C.)

   Getting a core dump on the second pass currently.  

2000-07-7  Danny Thorne

   Note: One of the main things that I'm doing in SAGE is like this:

         a_SgType_ptr theType=sage_gen_type(type);
      #if FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
         if( preinit_pass && current_preinit_task_failed ) return NULL;
         if( theType == NULL ) { /* ?? */ }
      #endif /* FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES */

   Just a check after any call to a SAGE routine for the state of the current_
   preinit_task_failed flag.  Note that I'm including a check on the thing
   being returned by the SAGE routine, in the case that current_preinit_task_
   failed is FALSE, but doing nothing about it.  I think that there may be some
   cases when something should be done with the SAGE routine returns a NULL
   value without setting the current_preinit_task_failed to TRUE.  At least, it is
   not always acceptable to simply assert that the return value is non-NULL.

   Note: Sometimes I have to transform something like this:
  
      result=new SgCastExp(fi(type), (a_SgExpression_ptr)0L, sage_gen_type(type),0);

   into something like this:

      #if FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
         a_SgType_ptr theType = sage_gen_type(type);
         if( preinit_pass && current_preinit_task_failed ) return NULL;
         if( theType == NULL ) { /* ?? */ }
         result=new SgCastExp(fi(type), (a_SgExpression_ptr)0L, theType,0);
      #else /* FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES */
         result=new SgCastExp(fi(type), (a_SgExpression_ptr)0L, sage_gen_type(type),0);
      #endif /* FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES */

2000-07-6  Danny Thorne

   Ditto.

2000-07-5  Danny Thorne

   Continued working on the current_preinit_pass_failed mechanism.  Started 
   working from the top of sage_gen_be.C and covering every function in the 
   order that they appear in the file.

2000-07-4  Danny Thorne

   Added current_preinit_pass_failed to sage_gen_be.C and externed it from 
   sage_il_to_str.C and began incorporating it into the codes.  Note that I also
   externed preinit_pass from sage_gen_be.C in sage_il_to_str.C.

2000-07-3  Danny Thorne

   Working on implementing the mechanism discussed at the end of the day Friday 
   with Dan.  Went to speak with Dan and browse the code.  This lasted all afternoon.

   One thing I realized while browsing the code with Dan is that I've been a little
   conservative with comments in places.  I'm going through and rectifying some of
   this now.  I probably won't get around to really fleshing out the new
   implementation of FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES until tomorrow
   (or the following day, if I stay home tomorrow).

   Another thing:  As each IL entry is encountered during the preinit passes,
   we should output the filename and line number where it occurs.

2000-06-30  Danny Thorne

   Spoke with Dan about SAGE for a while.  We'll start working together a little
   more closely so that Dan will be prepared for my departure in August.  He needs
   to be able to pick up where I left off.  One thing we decided on is to
   implement a uniform mechanism across the existing sage_gen, sage_form routines
   for recovering from failed attempts during the preinit stage.  Currently there
   are a couple of cases (e.g. routines that return a value and routines that
   don't return a value), and there is the problem that sometimes it is actually
   okay for a sage_ routine to return a NULL value, so we cannot expect returning
   a NULL pointer to always uniquely identify the nature of the situation.  The
   best idea, all things considered, I think, is to have a global variable to
   indicate whether the current preinit task is currently successful or has
   failed.  By "preinit task" I mean a call to a sage_gen_ routine from with
   the sage_preinit_ routines .

2000-06-29  Danny Thorne

   The preinit stage doesn't core dump on the STL test code at this point, but 
   it doesn't finish initializing everything either.  And when control flows 
   to sage_process_file_scope_entities() after the preinit stage, we encounter 
   an infinite loop for some reason.  It happens because the first 
   curr_source_sequence_entry is an iek_end_of_construct upon which the call
   to sage_gen_declaration() returns immediately without advancing the source
   sequence entry.  Then sage_process_file_scope_entities() calls sage_gen_decl-
   aration() again without first advancing the source sequence entry.  So this
   goes on forever.  It would be easy to fix by just going ahead and advancing
   the source sequence entry, but the problem never happened before, and now it
   happens even if I skip the preinit stage altogether, and I feel like I should
   try to figure out what is causing it.  I haven't figured out what's causing it
   yet, though.

   Note that if I eliminate all the preinit stuff with preprocessing directive,
   then SAGE runs normally.

   NOTE:  Need to centralize the flags associated with toggling stuff related
   to the preinit stage and template instantiations.  Maybe put them in
   host_envir.h or something like that.  Currently there are flags in
   sage_gen_be.C, sage_il_to_str.C, il_to_str.h, cfe.c, etc that need to be
   edited individually in order to eliminate all preinit and template instan-
   tiation stuff during preprocessing.

   I can turn on PREINIT_IL in sage_gen_be.C and pass the -preinit_il flag to
   ROSE and still SAGE runs smoothly, but when I turn on FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_
   EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES I get the infinite loop.

   Fixed the infinite loop by putting if(preinit_pass) before all the
   FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES stuff in SAGE.  There was a
   return NULL that was happening in sage_gen_class_definition() that was
   somehow causing the infinite loop when encountered by SAGE outside of the
   context of the preinit stage. 

2000-06-28  Danny Thorne

   Decided to turn TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE off and see if I can get 
   the preinit stage to work that way again.  Getting another case of an 
   incomplete SgSymbol.  In sage_gen_tag_reference(), the following assert 
   is failing: assert(parentsym->get_declaration()!=NULL).

   We need to somehow make sure that the preinit stage always gives rise to either
   a complete SgSymbol or no SgSymbol at all on a given pass.

   I put code in sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity_check_types and
   sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity_check() to output a notice
   whenever there is a type symbol that doesn't have a declaration and to output
   an indication of exactly what kind of symbol it is (e.g. SgClassSymbol,
   SgFunctionSymbol, ... ), and it looks like that it is only SgClassSymbols that
   are showing up with no declaration (so far).

   Put asserts before new class symbol creations throughout sage_gen_be.C to
   assert that the class declaration passed to the constructor is not NULL, and
   taught the preinit stage how to bail on creating a SgClassSymbol if the call
   to sage_gen_class_definition() returns NULL.

   Added code to keep track of the total number of entities, total number of type
   entities, number of entities that are unintitialized and number of type entities
   that are uninitialized.  These are output after each preinit pass.

2000-06-27  Danny Thorne

   Continuing to debug the miscellaneous problems that come up when running 
   ROSE on the STL test code with TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE turned on.

   It gets successfully through three passes now (until late this afternoon, it
   was failing during the third pass).  I'm at a point where I have reason to
   wonder whether all il entries that have no name (i.e. source_corresp.name==NULL)
   should have a SgDefaultSymbol or there are cases when an entry might have no
   name but deserve a specialized SgSymbol.  It comes up at the top of
   sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr() in the following snippet:

     if( get_symbol_ptr(tp->source_corresp)!=NULL &&
         isSgDefaultSymbol(get_symbol_ptr(tp->source_corresp))==FALSE )
     {
       assert(tp->source_corresp.name!=NULL); // (1)
       if(tp->sg_type_ptr==NULL) 
          tp->sg_type_ptr = get_symbol_ptr(tp->source_corresp)->get_type();
       assert(tp->sg_type_ptr!=NULL);         // (2)
       return;
     }

   Assert (1) fails sometimes, indicating that there are il entries with a
   specialized SgSymbol (by specialized, I mean other than SgDefaultSymbol) that
   have no name.  I'm not sure how/where those SgSymbols are being created yet, but
   one case where this happens is when sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr() is called
   recursively from case tk_typeref on under_type:

      under_type = tp->variant.typeref.type;
      if(under_type!=NULL)
         sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr(under_type); // This call sometimes gives
                                                   // rise to the failure of
                                                   // assert (1) above.

   Continued trying to fix the handling of template arguments.

   Added a field

      a_boolean output_name_returned_null;

   to

      struct an_il_to_str_output_control_block

   in il_to_str.h, and added an argument

      a_boolean return_null

   to

      gen_name_reference()

   and

      sage_gen_name_reference()

   which are the functions that octl->output_name() point
   to, where octl is of type an_il_to_str_output_control_block.
   So &(octl->output_name_returned_null) is passed as the
   boolean return_null in the call to octl->output_name()
   in order to know when subsequent calls within output_name()
   fail during the preinit stage.  This catches at least one
   case of sage_form_template_args() failing during the preinit
   stage.  This fix requires the extra field and parameter because
   of the fact that sage_gen_name_reference() does not return
   a value (and, hence, cannot return NULL as other functions can
   when an attempt fails during the preinit stage).

   This fix gave rise to many other miscellaneous problems, primarily
   associated with the problem of teaching SAGE to defer gracefully
   until a following pass in the cases that something cannot be
   completely handled in the current pass.

   I'm still in the process of tracking down and fixing all of
   these problems.

   Note that the flag FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
   toggles the inclusion of the new things I'm putting in to the
   existing SAGE routines.  It also now is used in il_to_str.h
   where an_il_to_str_output_control_block is defined.  In fact,
   il_to_str.h is included by sage_il_to_str.h which is included
   by both sage_gen_be.C and sage_il_to_str.C, so the best place
   to toggled this flag is in il_to_str.h.

2000-06-23  Danny Thorne

   Turned on TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE and working on getting 
   sage_form_template_args() and peripheral routines to work.  Arranging for 
   sage_form_template_args() to return an empty list in the case that it can't 
   create a symbol for one of the arguments.  Spent some time trying to figure 
   out how to determine if an STL list is empty so I could check in the routine 
   that calls sage_form_template_args() whether formation of the arguments was 
   successful or not.  Finally realized that there is a "size()" member function.

   Put code in cases tk_class, tk_struct, tk_union, and tk_routine to handle
   arguments of templates prior to handling the class itself.  Haven't quite gotten
   this to work correctly yet.

2000-06-22  Danny Thorne

   Just needed to make a couple more tweaks, and now the preinit stage 
   successfully initializes all types in the tree for the STL test code as well 
   as for others of my test codes that I've tried.

   Now I need to arrange for the flag preinit_anything_this_pass to be handled
   correctly so that the preinit stage can have a meaningful stopping criteria
   (namely, preinit_anything_this_pass==FALSE ==> stop).

   Did that, and also built functions to traverse the tree and check for
   any il entry that doesn't have an initialized sg_symbol_ptr so that the
   stopping criteria can be verified directly at the end.

   Note that presently the STL test code will not terminate because of the presence
   of tk_arrays which I haven't implemented yet.  I'm not yet sure how to handle
   them.

   I ended up handling them by just creating a SgVariableSymbol for them.  I'm a
   nervous about creating SgVariableSymbols in some of the cases in sage_gen_type_
   symbol_ptr().  But there is no SgTypeSymbol and no other symbol that makes
   any more sense in cases like tk_array than SgVariableSymbol.

2000-06-21  Danny Thorne

   Realized that I was trying to fix sage_gen_class_definition() to handle the
   case that the calls to sage_gen_declaration() were aborted during the preinit
   stage (to handle the out-of-sync source sequence entry that resulted, that is),
   but all it needs to do is recognize the fact and return a NULL pointer at that
   point.

   Fixing this opened a flood-gate of miscellaneous other problems that I've been
   knocking off pretty easily so far.

   Added the following:

      if( get_symbol_ptr(rp->type->source_corresp)==NULL )
         sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr(rp->type);

   to case iek_routine in sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity().

   This gave rise to more miscellaneous problems.

   Here's an example problem:

      main
      edg_main
      sage_preinit_il
      sage_preinit_file_scope_entities
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_list
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity
      sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr -- tp --> type,
      sage_gen_type -- type --> type,
      sage_form_type -- type --> type,
      sage_form_type_second_part -- type --> type,
      sage_form_function_declarator -- type --> type,
      sage_gen_function_declarator_with_scope -- type --> type,
                                                 rtsp = type->variant.routine.extra_info,
                                                 param = rtsp->param_type_list,
                                                 param->type --> type,
      sage_gen_type -- type --> type,
      sage_form_type -- type --> type,
      sage_form_type_first_part -- type->variant.pointer.type --> type,
      sage_form_type_first_part -- get_symbol_ptr(type->source_corresp) == NULL.

   That is:

      get_symbol_ptr(tp->variant.routine.extra_info->param_type_list->type->variant.pointer.type->source_corresp) == NULL.

   I wrote it up in order to help trace the problem back to the
   source where I can handle it.

   Finally fixed that.  Now I'm getting another similar problem ending
   with sage_form_type_first_part passing type->variant.pointer.type
   to itself.

   I'm thinking that maybe we should handle all pointer types first.
   I think I'll try that.

   Added preinit_pointer_types_this_pass and preinit_pointer_types_done.

   I couldn't get that to work right.  I fixed the problem by just
   checking tp->variant.routine.extra_info->param_type_list->type->variant.pointer.type->source_corresp
   explicitly for now.

   Fixed several other problems.

   Experimented with putting a call to sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr(tp->next)
   within sage_preinit_type_symbol_ptr(), but that didn't work (the recursion
   entered a cycle, somehow).  I tried putting the recursive call in both
   the front and the back.

   Note that preinit_types_done is being set to TRUE prematurely.  For instance,
   after it is TRUE we have get_symbol_ptr(rp->type->source_corresp)==NULL in
   sage_preinit_routine_symbol_ptr().

   I think I need to write a routine to traverse the IL tree and check types for
   NULL sg_symbol_ptrs before allowing preinit_types_done to be TRUE.

   Did that.  Now the code never terminates.  Nothing new is created after the
   third pass.  (That is for the STL_TEST test code.)

   Added sage_preinit_type_symbols_is_complete(),
         sage_preinit_source_sequence_list_check_types(), and
         sage_preinit_source_sequence_entry_check_types().

   These routines give any type with no name (tp->source_corresp.name==NULL) a
   SgDefaultSymbol.  If any other type is encountered that has a NULL
   sg_symbol_ptr, sage_preinit_type_symbols_is_complete() returns FALSE
   and preinit_types_done remains FALSE for another pass.

   At this point, sage_preinit_type_symbols_is_complete() never returns TRUE
   for the STL test code.

   Need to give any SgDefaultSymbols a SgTypeDefault in the case iek_type.
   I arranged for SgDefaultSymbol to have this (see ROSE/ROSETTA/symbol.C).

   Q: Should all type_kinds have a non-NULL sg_type_ptr.  That is, should there
      be a SgType corresponding to every "struct a_type" in the tree?  Note that
      in some cases the SgSymbol does not have a type member.

   In the case of routines (tk_routine), I've allowed NULL sg_type_ptrs.

2000-06-20  Danny Thorne
   Changed sage_gen_{routine,type,...}_symbol_ptr() to
   sage_preinit_{routine,type,...}_symbol_ptr() everywhere in sage_gen_be.C.
   This was an oversight in naming convention on my part at the beginning
   of development of the preinit stage.

   Began experimenting with teaching existing SAGE routines to fail gracefully
   during the preinit stage and allow the current pass to continue instead of
   tripping an assert.  I'm beginning to think that this will be the only
   viable way.  One manner of achieving this, though, would be to write a
   sage_preinit_...() routine to correspond to every sage_gen_...() routine.
   I haven't quite been driven to that extreme, yet. 

   Note that the pieces of code in the existing SAGE routines that are for the
   purpose of facilitating the preinit stage are wrapped within
   
      #define FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES 1
      #if FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES
      #endif

   The flag is set on a case-by-case basis during developement in order to 
   toggled individual pieces separately.  Eventually, if this approach works,
   the FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES should be toggled based
   on the state of the "preinti_il" run-time parameter.

   So far FACILITATE_PREINIT_IN_EXISTING_SAGE_ROUTINES sections exist in
   sage_gen_class_definition() and sage_gen_tag_reference().  These things will
   propogate throughout the code, though, probably, because whenever a
   sage_gen_() routine fails during the preinit stage without tripping an
   assert, it returns a NULL pointer; hence, any calling routines will need
   to be equipped to accomodate receiving a NULL pointer which is something
   that many of them don't currently tolerate.  A trickier problem is 
   associated with the fact that when a sage_gen_() routine terminates
   abnormally, the curr_source_sequence_ptr may not have been advanced to
   the point that the calling routine will expect.  It's hard to figure out
   what exactly should be done with the curr_source_sequence_ptr in such
   a case.

2000-06-19  Danny Thorne
   Working on order-of-preinit of entries.  For instance, need to preinit base-
   classes before preinit-ing derived classes.  Sometimes it's necessary to
   preinit nested classes before preinit-ing the parent class, and sometimes
   it's necessary to have preinit-ed the parent class in order to preinit
   something inside of it.

2000-06-16  Danny Thorne
   Need to figure out the problem I was working on at the end of
   yesterday.  Here is the call stack again, this time with an indication
   of where the offending type pointer came from.

      main
      edg_main
      sage_preinit_il
      sage_preinit_file_scope_entities
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_list
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity
      sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr 
      sage_gen_routine_decl ------ if (curr_src_seq_entry_is_secondary_decl(&sec_decl))
                                      rout = ss_entry_ptr(sec_decl, a_routine_ptr),
                                   else
                                      rout = ss_entry_ptr(curr_source_sequence_entry, a_routine_ptr),
                                   scope_region_number = rout->assoc_scope,
                                   scope = il_header.region_scope_entry[scope_region_number],
                                   scope->assoc_block --> statement,
      sage_gen_statement --------- statement --> statement,
      sage_gen_block_statement --- statement->variant.block.statements --> statement,
      sage_gen_statement_list ---- statement --> statement,
      sage_gen_statement --------- statement->expr --> expr,
      sage_gen_initializer_expr -- expr --> expr,
      sage_gen_expr -------------- operand_1 = expr->variant.operation.operands,
                                   operand_1 --> node,
      sage_gen_lvalue ------------ node --> expr,
      sage_gen_expr -------------- operand_1 = expr->variant.operation.operands,
                                   rout = operand_1->variant.routine, 
                                   rout --> rout,
      sage_gen_routine_name ------ rout->declared_type --> type,
      sage_gen_type -------------- type --> type,
      sage_form_type ------------- type --> type,
      sage_form_type_first_part -- type->variant.routine.return_type --> type,
      sage_form_type ------------- type --> type,
      sage_form_type_first_part -- type->variant.pointer.type --> type,
      sage_form_type_first_part -- type->source_corresp.sg_symbol_ptr == NULL.

   I don't think it's possible to check for a case like this before calling 
   sage_gen_ routine_decl() from sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr() in the first place.  
   There are essentially an infinite number of ways to get from sage_gen_routine_
   decl() to sage_form_type_first_part() and have this problem I think.  It depends
   entirely on what the code looks like that's being compiled.

   I see two possible solutions.  For one, we could teach the existing SAGE routines,
   like sage_form_type_first_part(), to behave differently during the preinit stage
   (see comments in 2000-06-14).  Another possibility is that we don't try to process any
   routine declarations until all type declarations have been handled.  That is, 
   we do only types during the first couple of passes and then start doing routines
   on later passes.  The latter solution is more desirable by far if it will work.
   
   Moved the loop control of sage_preinit_il() to within sage_preinit_il() and
   call sage_preinit_il() just one time from EDG_MAIN in cfe.c.  Previously, I
   was looping within cfe.c to call sage_preinit_il() multiple times.  

   Added some preinit related flags to sage_gen_be.C:

      preinit_types_this_pass -- Will be initialized to FALSE before each pass, and 
         then during that pass of the preinit stage it will be set to TRUE if any
         sg_symbol_ptr for a type is initialized.

      preinit_types_done -- Will be initialized to FALSE at file scope, and then
         after any preinit pass if preinit_types_this_pass is still FALSE this
         flag will be set to TRUE.

      preinit_anything_this_pass -- Will be initialized to FALSE at the beginning
         of each pass, and then at the end of the pass if this flag is still FALSE
         the preinit stage will end.  Anytime during the preinit pass that any
         sg_symbol_ptr is initialized, this flag will be set to TRUE.

   Probably will need quite a few more flags like that.  Probabably will need
   to handle classes that have no parents first before classes that have parents.
   Will probably want to handle primitive types before handling classes at all.  
   In each of these cases there will need to be a flag, like, say:

      preinit_primitive_types_this_pass
      preinit_primitive_types_done
      preinit_parent_classes_this_pass
      preinit_parent_classes_done

   where "parent" actually means "having no parents" in this context as opposed
   to meaning that it necessarily has children.

   The thing that worries me is what if, for instance, there are cases where 
   neither the parent class nor its children can be created independently of
   one another in some way? Well, it must be possible to always create them
   independently somehow, but maybe not with existing SAGE routines.  

2000-06-15  Danny Thorne
   Fixed the NULL curr_source_sequence_entry in tk_typeref (mentioned at the end
   of yesterday) by just creating a SgTypedefDeclaration object from scratch 
   with no SgDeclarationStatement and no SgSymbol for the parent.  When the 
   curr_source_sequence_entry is non-NULL it goes ahead and creates the 
   SgTypedefDeclaration by calling sage_gen_typedef_definition().

   Fixed several miscellaneous problems associated with what to handle on the 
   first pass and what to defer until the second pass.

   Milestone: The first pass completes successfully with ROSE/ROSE_TEST/
              STL_TEST/templates_stl.C finally.  Core dumps on the second
              pass though. 

   Having trouble getting the second pass to work on templates_stl.C.  There's a
   point at which the call stack looks like this:

      main(argc = 10, argv = 0xffbef37c)
      edg_main(argc = 29, argv = 0x4d1f08)
      sage_preinit_il()
      sage_preinit_file_scope_entities(top = CLASS)
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_list(ssep = 0x63780c)
      sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity(void_ssep = 0x63797c, ssep_kind = ',')
      sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr(rp = 0x637930)
      sage_gen_routine_decl(suppress_specifiers = 0, ...
      sage_gen_statement(statement = 0x646980)
      sage_gen_block_statement(statement = 0x646980)
      sage_gen_statement_list(stmt_list = 0x6469d0, ...
      sage_gen_statement(statement = 0x6469d0)
      sage_gen_initializer_expr(expr = 0x646b44, type = 0x6372b8, need_parens = 0)
      sage_gen_expr(expr = 0x646b44, need_parens = 0)
      sage_gen_lvalue(node = 0x646b2c)
      sage_gen_expr(expr = 0x646b2c, need_parens = 1)
      sage_gen_routine_name(rout = 0x641204)
      sage_gen_type(type = 0x641338)
      sage_form_type(type = 0x641338, octl = 0x4baf4c, under_a_class = (nil))
      sage_form_type_first_part(type = 0x641338, ...
      sage_form_type(type = 0x6412c4, octl = 0x4baf4c, under_a_class = (nil))
      sage_form_type_first_part(type = 0x6412c4, ...
      sage_form_type_first_part(type = 0x638344, ...

   and something is missing that's needed in sage_form_type_first_part()  at
   the top (bottom of the the listing here), and I haven't yet been able to even 
   figure out what it is that needs to be checked in sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr() 
   before calling sage_gen_routine_decl() to make sure this doesn't happen, and 
   once I figure that out I'm not sure what I'm going to do about it exactly.

   On a more positive note, the two preinit passes complete successfully and
   ROSE completes successfully when I run it on my small ROSE/ROSE_TEST/PREINIT_TEST
   test codes and my ROSE/ROSE_TEST/templates.C test code.  There's just something
   about STL that continues to thwart.

2000-06-14  Danny Thorne
   Introduced all of the remaining il_entry_kinds (there were many) into the switch
   statement in sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity().

   Fixed tk_typeref in sage_gen_type_symbol_ptr() to use sage_gen_typedef_definition()
   instead of trying to create the SgTypedefDeclaration from scratch all by itself.

   Introduced SgDefaultSymbol in ROSE/ROSETTA/symbol.C.  This took quite a bit of
   tinkering to get working.  The problem stemmed from the fact that each symbol
   is expected to have a declaration field by default.  I had to figure out how
   to turn this off.  I ended up still having to have a name field which I just
   initialized to SgdefaultName.  Of course, in symbol.c "Sg" is represented
   by $GRAMMAR_PREFIX_.

   Modified tk_class to call sage_gen_class_definition() instead of trying to
   create SgClassDeclaration by itself from scratch, but this didn't work in
   all cases.  sage_gen_class_definition() requires other stuff to be around
   that the preinit stage hasn't encountered yet, so I changed it to just
   create a watered down version of SgClassDeclaration by itself on the
   first preinit pass and then try to call sage_gen_class_definition() on the
   second pass.  That way hopefully the first pass eventually created everything
   necessary for sage_gen_class_definition() to run on the second pass.  By
   "watered down" I mean basically a SgClassDeclaration whose constructor is
   passed a NULL SgClassDefinition pointer.  This has an obvious caveat.  The
   things that are created later in the first pass may not be complete after
   the first pass and so may be insufficient for the call to sage_gen_class_
   definition() on the second pass.  The best way to handle this may be to
   make the sage_gen_ routines behave differently during the preinit stage.
   In particular, they might merely set a flag instead of failing an assert
   during the preinit stage.  I've created a global variable in sage_gen_be.C
   called preinit_pass which is an integer indicating the number of the
   current pass.  After the preinit stage is complete, this variable could be
   set to zero, and hence the SAGE routines could easily know when they are
   called from the preinit stage, e.g. with if(preinit_pass).  So we could
   have something like this:

      if(preinit_pass) { /* Set a flag. */; return; }
      else assert(get_symbol_ptr()!=NULL);

   The flag will presumably be a field or member of either an il tree node
   or a Sg object.  The problem with this is that the calling routines
   will need to be able to detect that the process has aborted.  Maybe it's
   better to try to handle this in a way that won't require so much
   intrusion into existing SAGE routines.

   Maybe the way to do this is to have several preinit passes and on the nth
   pass check each entry to see how deeply it is dependent on other stuff, and
   create it if there is nothing buried >=n deep that it needs before
   being created.  For example, when checking whether to create a SgClassSymbol
   for a_type_ptr tp, where tp->kind == tk_class, if

      tp->variant.class_struct_union.extra_info->base_classes != NULL

   then this SgClassSymbol could not be created on the first pass because
   sage_gen_class_definition() requires that the sg_symbol_ptrs for the
   base_classes be defined.

   Have similar problem when calling sage_gen_type() from sage_gen_type_symbol_ptr()
   sometimes.  Need to have tp->source_corresp.parent.class_type handled first.

   And in sage_gen_variable_symbol_ptr(), need to handle
   vp->type->variant.pointer.type first if it exists.

   Began trying to implement some things related to the idea mentioned
   above involving several passes where management is restricted to the new
   preinit routines as opposed to involving the existing SAGE routines. Overcame
   several obstacles until finally getting stuck in tk_typeref in sage_gen_type_
   symbol_ptr() where there is an occasion when tp->source_corresp.source_sequence_entry
   is NULL which is causing the call to sage_gen_typedef_definition() to fail
   since I'm setting curr_source_sequence_entry = tp->source_corresp.source_sequence_entry
   and sage_gen_typedef_definition() uses curr_source_sequence_entry.

2000-06-13  Danny Thorne
   Modified sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr() to call sage_gen_routine_decl() 
   instead of trying to create the SgFunctionDeclaration from scratch by itself.  
   This requires making sure that the curr_source_sequence_entry is set to the 
   source sequence entry for the a_routine_ptr passed to 
   sage_gen_routine_symbol_ptr().

   Fixed case iek_block in sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity().  Had 
   previously not realized that struct a_block has an assoc_scope that is of 
   type a_scope_ptr (cf. 2000-06-02).  That confusion stems from the fact that 
   struct a_routine has an assoc_scope that is an integer (albeit typedef-ed to 
   a_memory_region_number).  At any rate, I haven't seen this case occur yet, 
   and I'm not sure under what circumstances it will occur.  I tried putting an 
   explicit block in the middle of my main() code, but that didn't give rise to 
   an iek_block entry.

2000-06-12  Danny Thorne
   Noticed that chars are stored as ints in EDG.

   Worked on fleshing out sage_gen_type_symbol_ptr().  Wrote code for 
   tk_routine, tk_class, tk_struct, and tk_union.

2000-06-09  Danny Thorne
   Created type_kind_names[] and statement_kind_tag_names[] arrays in il_def.h.
   There was already one of these for an_il_entry_kind.  I wish there were 
   already one for all of the enums in il_def.h.

2000-06-08  Danny Thorne
   Have working code in

      sage_gen_type_symbol_ptr()

   and

      sage_gen_variable_symbol_ptr()

   for creating SgVariableSymbol and SgTypedefSymbol objects, as well as
   SgType objects.  These are used to initialize the sg_symbol_ptr and
   sg_type_ptr fields in the IL tree.  Note that this code currently only 
   implements typedef-ed types that come from tk_integers, tk_floats and
   tk_pointers.  

   NOTE:  The assoc_info field in source_corresp can be dereferenced like this,
   for instance:

     *(a_symbol_ptr)vp->source_corresp.assoc_info

   where the cast is necessary.  Anyway, this has quite a bit of information in
   it.  It might be worth keeping in mind.  It occurs to me to wonder if it 
   should be sufficient to have SgSymbol constructors take just one of these: 
   a_symbol_ptr. A question related to that: How to use the decl_seq field of 
   "struct a_symbol" to access the declaration itself? decl_seq is supposed to 
   uniquely identify the declaration associated with the current symbol (in the 
   current scope).  At any rate, I haven't used source_corresp.assoc_info in
   ROSE/SAGE yet, but I wanted to mention it as something that might be useful
   in the future.

2000-06-06  Danny Thorne
   Added 

      sage_preinit_source_sequence_list() 

   to be called from 

      sage_preinit_file_scope_entities() 

   and which will be able to call itself in the case of src_seq_sublists.  It 
   may also be called for source sequence lists associated with file scopes and 
   block scopes instead of sage_preinit_{function,block}_scope_entities(),
   which is what was being called previously and which more-or-less duplicates the
   work being done in sage_preinit_source_sequence_list() now.  This is pending
   any discoveries that suggest it's more desirable to have separate functions
   to handle function and block scope source sequence lists.

   Fixed a major blunder in 

      sage_gen_type_symbol_ptr()

   that was associated with the particular enum being used to index the cases
   in the switch statement.  Previously, an_il_entry_kind was being used, but  
   it was supposed to use a_type_kind.  This makes a big difference, of course.

2000-06-02  Danny Thorne
   Added cases for iek_block and iek_statement to 

      sage_preinit_source_sequence_entity() 

   and added functions

      sage_preinit_function_scope_entities() 
      sage_preinit_block_scope_entities()

   to compliment sage_preinit_file_scope_entities().  These are still under
   developement, however. (And I'm not sure if the one for block scopes is
   really necessary, because it turns out that there actually is not a scope
   associated with blocks -- that is, struct a_block does not contain an
   assoc_scope field. [DT] 6/16/2000 -- No, that's wrong.  See 2000-06-13.)

   The effect of this presently is that the preinit stage now prints out to
   the screen the stuff that is within the scope of functions as opposed to
   just the stuff that is at file scope.  This distinction wasn't sufficiently
   discussed in previous entries to this ChangeLog, by the way.  I was
   under the impression that the source sequence list traversed through
   all scopes, which is not the case.  Access to the source sequence list for
   a scope associated with a function for instance, given a_routine_ptr rp,
   could be achieved as follows:

   // Grab the scope associated with the function.
      a_scope_ptr sp = il_header.region_scope_entry[rp->assoc_scope];
   // Get the source sequence from the scope.
      a_source_sequence_entry ssep = sp->source_sequence_list;

   Note that ROSE/ROSE_TEST/PREINIT_TEST has been added to the repository and
   includes small codes that are convenient for trouble-shooting the preinit
   stage while it is being developed.

2000-05-31  Danny Thorne
   Tried to arrange to call disp_file_scope_il() from sage_gen_be.C, but wasn't
   successful.  It's being declared as an extern in sage_gen_be.C, and it's
   defined in il_display.c.  I had to add il_display.c to the Makefile, first
   of all, and I verified after that (using ar -tv and nm) that libedg.a did
   in fact receive a non-empty il_display.o and that il_display.o contains a 
   definition of disp_file_scope_il(), but for some reason I always get an
   undefined symbol error for disp_file_scope_il() at link-time.  However, I
   was able to call disp_file_scope_il() from cfe.c just before the call to
   the backend, and perhaps this will be sufficient, although the output from
   disp_file_scope_il() is not quite as useful as I had hoped.

   The motivation for using disp_file_scope_il() is to facilitate figuring
   out how to find instances of primitive types for which we can create SAGE
   objects easily.  The only way I've found of locating a refernce to "i"
   in the small code below (2000-05-29) is through the "scope" structure,
   which is of type "struct a_scope" (see ROSE/EDG/src/il_def.h).  In general,
   the "scope" structure offers more convenient access to stuff than the
   source sequence does.  That might be something to keep in mind. 

   Added a ROSE command line flag, -preinit_il, for the purpose of turning
   on the preinit stage.  The default now will be to *not* do the preinit,
   and the -preinit_il flag will need to be passed in order to enable the
   call to the preinit routine.  This will make it convenient in the 
   context of the CVS repository.  I will be able to leave the preinit
   functionality in ROSE when I do a check in, but users won't encounter
   it unless they explicitly ask for it on the command line.  Of course,
   when the preinit stage works the way we want it to, then maybe it will
   be better to have the preinit stage be *on* by default and offer to 
   the user functionality for turning it off explicitly if they have reason
   to think it is undesirable in a particular case.  NOTE:  The preinit
   stage probably often *will* be somewhat undesirable considering that
   by-and-large ROSE works fine as is.  So far the only code that has
   broken it is STL.  Support for STL is the primary motivation for
   the preinit stage and subsequent special handling of templates in
   SAGE and ROSE.

2000-05-29  Danny Thorne
   Created ROSE/ROSE_TEST/PREINIT_TEST/test01.C which looks like this:
  
      main() { int i; i = 1; return 0; }

   in order to trouble-shoot the preinit procedure more conveniently.
   In particular, we are considering the idea of passing through the source
   sequence first to initialize SAGE objects associated with just primitive
   types and build from there in an iterative manner until we are able to
   build SgSymbol objects.  That is as opposed to trying to build SgSymbol 
   objects by recursively building everything needed for a each individual
   SgSymbol object, one SgSymbol object at a time. (cf. 2000-05-26)

2000-05-26  Danny Thorne
   sage_preinit_file_scope_entities() now handles secondary source sequence
   declarations and end-of-construct entries.  It also prints out the names
   of each entry in addition to the "kind" of each entry.  I've started
   attempting to build SgSymbol objects in order to initialize sg_symbol_ptrs
   but it's not turning out to be straight-forward.  Each SgSymbol object
   constructor requires some other SAGE object which in turn requires other
   SAGE objects, etcetera.  It's hard to know at what point to terminate
   this recursion, and it's hard to know how to build all the necessary
   SAGE objects in this recursion at all.  This is more or less the problem
   that we were hoping to avoid by the preinit strategy.  The means by
   which we expect to be able to avoid this problem is multiple passes
   through the source sequence.  Maybe we need to begin this strategy from
   the perspective of other more easily constructed SAGE objects (like those
   associated with primitive types, for instance) instead of from the
   perspective of SgSymbols themselves, in spite of the fact that it is the
   SgSymbols that we really want in the end.  Altering our perspective in
   this way should make it easier to take advantage of multiple passes of
   the source sequence and avoid convoluted recursion.  At each successive
   pass we should be equiped to easily create some slightly higher level
   objects from other objects that exists from previous passes.  Finally,
   on the last pass, we should have everything necessary to create SgSymbol
   objects for the highest level entities from pre-existing objects.

2000-05-22  Danny Thorne
   sage_preinit_file_scope_entities() now prints out the name of each entry
   (for routines and types).  Working on a general solution for handling
   the seconary source sequence declarations and end of construct entries.
   When this is in place, it will just be a matter of building sg_symbol_ptrs
   and such instead of printing to the screen.

2000-05-19  Danny Thorne
   Began creating sage_preinit_il.C containing the function sage_preinit_il() 
   which is called from EDG_MAIN() in cfe.c immediately prior to the call
   to sage_back_end().  The purpose of sage_preinit_il() is to make one or
   more passes through the source sequence and initialize as many as possible
   of the sg_symbol_ptr, sg_type_ptr, and any other SAGE item existing in
   the IL tree.  This is intended to greatly facilitate the integrity of
   the SAGE back end which often depends on these pointers being non-NULL
   but which sometimes isn't sure how to generate them on the fly.

   Later:  Decided just to create sage_preinit_il() within sage_gen_be.C
   directly.  Also created init_sage_preinit_il() and 
   sage_preinit_file_scope_entities().  Currently it just passes through
   the source sequence list and prints out the kind of each entry. 

2000-05-18  Danny Thorne
   Have been working on handling templates with DQ:  

     * Have added TemplateInstantiationSymbol, TemplateInstantiationDecl, 
       TemplateInstantiationDefn, and TemplateInstantiationType elements to 
       the grammar (see ROSE/ROSETTA and ROSE/ROSETTA/Grammar).

     * Added sage_form_template_args() to sage_il_to_str.C and am calling this
       function from sage_gen_unqualified_name() which is in sage_gen_be.C.

     * We've done a lot of tinkering in the way of rectifying the spurious
       NULL sg_symbol_ptr fields in the source correspondence structure.  One
       place in particular that this is manifest is sage_gen_tag_reference().
       It's not working yet, though, and we've tentatively decided on a totally
       different approach now:  Make one or more passes through the source
       sequence to initialize sg_symbol_ptr (and, potentially, sg_type_ptr) as
       an intermediate step between the EDG front end and the SAGE back end.

     * Note that the stuff that's under construction related to the handling
       of the new TemplateInstantiation terminals in sage_gen_be.C and 
       sage_il_to_str.C can be toggled with the TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS_IN_SAGE
       flag.

2000-04-21  Danny Thorne
   Changed the default template instantiation mode in cmd_line.c to tim_all.
   This obviates the fix mentioned at the end of 2000-03-17.

2000-04-10  Danny Thorne
   Added isBinaryArithmaticOperator() and isBinaryInequalityOperator() to 
   rose.h/modified_sage.h.  Now can handle overloaded operator{+,-,*,/,+=,-=,*=,/=,<,>,<=,>=,!=},
   in addition to the ones that could be handled before: operator{=,(),[],!}.  I'm not
   sure about operator{++,--,<<,>>} -- I'll have to test those later.  I think they are
   implemented already. 

2000-04-06  Danny Thorne
   Fixed the unparser to unparse the overloaded == operator.  Previously
   it would unparse something like (x==y) as (x==)(y) in the case that x and y were not
   built in types, i.e. they were istantiations of classes with an overloaded == operator.
   To facilitate this, I added isBinaryEqualityOperator() to rose.h/modified_sage.h.
   Now the unparser outputs (x==y) correctly.  NOTE:  This is a special case of a more
   general problem.  The same fix needs to be implemented for operator<, operator>=, etc.
   Or, perhaps there is a general modification that can be made to handle all these
   cases instead of having to handle them each separately.

2000-04-05  Danny Thorne
   Put some code in place of assert(sym) in sage_gen_routine_name() in
   sage_gen_be.C.  In particular, I put the following: 

                 SgFunctionDeclaration *funcdecl =
                    new SgFunctionDeclaration(fi(rout->source_corresp), rname, sageType);
                 sym = new SgFunctionSymbol(funcdecl);
                 set_symbol_ptr(rout->source_corresp, sym);
                 insert_symbol_into_current_scope(rname, rout->source_corresp);
                 result = new SgFunctionRefExp(fi(rout), (a_SgFunctionSymbol_ptr) sym);

   to create a simple SgFunctionSymbol.  This is in an else clause that is rarely
   encountered, and in fact it should never be encountered.  What I've done here is
   just a temporary fix.  The better fix is to make sure that the source correspondence 
   for every object in the IL tree has a non-null sg_symbol_ptr.  Then the call to
   get_symbol_ptr(rout->source_corresp) earlier in sage_gen_routine_name() will never
   return NULL in the first place. See the comment in get_symbol_ptr() which is
   in sage_gen_be.h.

2000-03-30  Danny Thorne
   Fixed the unparser to unparse the overloaded [] operator in the
   desired manner.  Required working from the level of unparseFuncCall().  
   See the documentation in the source code.  NOTE:  This obviates the
   fix mentioned in 2000-03-21.

2000-03-21  Danny Thorne
   Changed unparseMFuncRef() to unparse .operator[] in the case of the
   overloaded [] operator.  Previously it would just unparse the brackets themselves.  Hence,
   object[index] would unparse as object[](index), which doesn't compile.  Now object[index] 
   unparses as object.operator[](index) which *does* compile. However, this is not the preferred
   solution really.  We would like the unparsed code to look the same as the original.  That
   fix will take more time, though, and I'm going to save it for later.

2000-03-17  Danny Thorne
   Finished extending the unparser to unparse files that are #included from
   the main source file.  Currently it is designed to unparse only files that are in the local
   directory.  It prefixes the unparsed files with "rose_", and it introduces this prefix into
   the #includes within the unparsed files.  

   For example:  Suppose templates_main.C includes templates_def.h which in turn includes
   templates_def.C.  The unparser unparses rose_templates_main.C, rose_templates_def.h, and
   rose_templates_def.C and modifies the #includes respectively.  If, say, iostream.h were
   included from templates_main.C then the unparser will just include it directly in
   rose_templates_main.C with no prefix and will not unparse a file called rose_iostream.h.

   Details:  Detail the additional objects and logic that were introduced in order to facilitate 
   this feature.

   Remaining issues:  Things like the fact that the file info object is sometimes NULL.  Might
   also discuss the potentially desirable flexibililty of this feature that isn't yet
   implemented like variable prefixes and variable paths to files considered for unparsing.
   3/20/2000 -- Another thing is the apparent need for a modification in should_be_instantiated() 
   within EDG/src/templates.c related to the instantiation_mode flag which we would like to be set
   to tim_all instead of tim_none. (3/21/2000 -- I did this later yesterday, but the issue
   may not be entirely resolved.  It will need to be tested.) (cf. 2000-04-21.)

2000-03-13  Danny Thorne
   Bug Fix: The %su and %sd format specifiers in count_digits() within the
   file unparser.C were causing a core dump.  They have been changed to %hu and %hd, respectively.

2000-03-02  Danny Thorne
   Bug Fix:  A mishandling of the attributes flag in SgDeclarationStatement
   object.  The attributes flag for SgDeclarationStatements was getting clobbered in member functions 
   that occur immediately after an access specifier.  This was caused by a misguided call to the 
   set_decl_attributes() member function of SgDeclarationStatements.  The proper call, which is
   now in place, is to setBit().  NOTE: Remarked the set_decl_attributes() member function out of 
   the SgDeclarationStatments class as a preventative measure.

2000-02-17  Danny Thorne
   Command line switches between backends (EDG and SAGE backends)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
1999-02-28  Dan Quinlan
 * Added autoconf and automake to ROSE
1999-06-21  Dan Quinlan
 * Added command line options to ROSE -help -version -o -new_unparser (and a few others)
 * Fixed Unparser to handle scopes (surrounding with "{" and "}")
 * Fixed some parts of multidimensional support (1D working not
   all multidimensional support present).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes_from_Sage2.txt:

This is a Change file describing the changes in SAGE3 from SAGE2.

   1) Unparser
      The unparser has been rewritten using parts of the SAGE2 unparser) to provide
      numerous options controling the output C++ code that is generate.  The most 
      obvious feature is that the output of the new unparser nearly matches that of its
      input.  Features of the new upnarser include:
      a) User comments
         All user comments are included from the original input code in the generated output C++ code.

      b) Preprocessor control flow
      c) Pragmas
         Pragmas are reproduced in the unparsed output.  They are also seen within the 
         new SAGE3 program tree (differently than in SAGE2))
      d) #Line xxx
         The preprocessor "#line xxx" are provided optionally
         to permit the user to veiw the original source code
         when viewing source code within the debugger.
      e) A dozen other options are include (more about that in 
         future documentation).

   2) New terminals built as part of the SAGE 3 program tree
      a) SgPragmaStatements
         Unbound pragmas are supported and given a representation as a SgStatment within the SAGE 3 program tree.
         Sg_File_Info objects are built for these statements that correctly record there location in the source code.

   3) Features added:
      a) Full STL support (previous version of SAGE had a partially
implements (or not working) option of using STL.  STL is now required
in the new version and the older modified STL source has been removed
to simplify the design of the newer version of SAGE.

      b) All grammars implemented using the grammer generator
(Rosetta) place class declarations into a single header file and all
source code for the class member function definitions are placed into
a single source file.  The reasoning behind separating source code and
headers into separate files is to provide for improved maintance
within a programming project.  Since the source code is generated
automatically we require no simplified maintance of the generated
source; and precisely the opposant, wish to discourage modification of
the generate source code.  To complicate matter, we expect to generate
many grammars and so keeping each grammas implementation to just two
files (a header file and a source file) greatly simplifies this.
Further the order of inclusion of headers within SAGE 2 seemed overly
complex (since there were many header files and because varying
amounts of source code were specified within the class declarations).

      c) The grammar generator now builds all class declarations
without any member function definitions, all member function
definitions are placed in the source code file.

      d) As a rule the grammar generator (Rosetta) builds all data
members as pointers to classes (e.g. 
SgExpressionRoot* p_expression_root;
instead of
SgExpressionRoot p_expression_root;)

This avoids the full declaration of a class before the class is
referenced (or included) within another class (as a data member).  We
feel this improves the organization and breaks the order of generation
of the resulting classes generated.

   4) Features remaining to add:
      a) Template Support

      b) Multiple file support

      c) 

   5) Bugs Fixed
      a) SAGE 2 sets parent statements and parent expression within all statement and expression objects.
         the new version makes this more general (so that the resulting graph has every node with a valid
         pointer to its parent).  The case of the SgExpressionRoot is more complex and the new version of 
         SAGE fixes a bug that set the parent of the statement containing a SgExpressionRoot object incorrectly.
         The fix is representing within the initialize_root member function.

      b) Memory handled in sage_gen_be.C in sage_gen_templates mixed new/delete with malloc/free.
