This directory contains policy checkers to enforce policies that ROSE places on its developers.
Each checker is an executable script (usually Perl) that can be executed from any source
directory and which will check that the policy is adhered to in that directory and below.

Each script name should be CamelCase (extensions are removed) and the name should be indicative
of the policy that is being enforced.  The script name will be used to generate messages about
what is being checked.  A script can be disabled by either removing execute permission or by
changing its name to end with ".disabled".

A policy checker should produce output (on stdout) only when a policy is violated. The format
that works best is to emit a line or paragraph describing the nature of the violation, followed
by a list, indented by two spaces, of all the locations and details of where the policy was
violated.

Policy checkers should not enter the following directories:
  * Directories containing an "include-staging" subdirectory. Such directoriess are
    build trees.
  * The src/frontend/CxxFrontend/EDG/EDG_* directories. ROSE has no control over
    the contents of these files since they belong to the Edison Design Group.
  * Any directory that contains a file name ".3rd_party_software"

Although each policy checker can be run individually, the scripts/policies-checker.sh is a
harness that runs all the policy checkers and then exits with non-zero status if any of them
failed.  Policy checkers should exit with zero status for success, 1-127 for errors, and 128-255
for warnings.
