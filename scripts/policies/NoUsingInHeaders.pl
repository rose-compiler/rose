Header files should not have a "using namespace" directive in an outer scope
since this causes unexpected behavior for code that uses those headers.

The following files violate this policy. Some of these violations may have
existed prior to this check, and you have triggered this failure by introducing
at least one new violation. Our goal is to ultimately eliminate all of these
violations so the list is more relevant to you.  It does not matter which
violation(s) you fix to get back below the threshold -- if you have time and
are feeling generous, fix a few! Thank you.
