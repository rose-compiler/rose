DESCRIPTION
    This script is used to generate an "installer" script implemented as
    a Bourne-shell script on UNIX-like systems (such as Linux or OSX) or
    as a binary executable on Windows-like systems. This generated installer
    supports a number of options for specifying the where the various
    directories are to be installed (prefix directory pathnames).

    UNIX-like host

       On a UNIX-like host (such as Linux or OSX) the generated installer
       script is implemented as a self-extracting Bourne-shell script
       carrying a tarball as a payload. mkinstaller requires tar on UNIX-like
       hosts.

       The installer script construction process:

          1) Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
             done by the mkinstaller script is done in a temp directory.
          2) Creation of a top level temporary directory under which all
             other temporaries will be created. Creation of an "accumulator",
             an "intermediate" and a "wrapper" directory in the top level
             temp directory. A tarup/untar process will use both the
             "intermediate" and "accumulator" directories to merge given
             directories with the same basename. The "wrapper" directory
             will be used to carry the individual directory tarballs.
          3) From each of the specified directories to be installed such
             as .../bin, .../lib, specified on the mkinstaller command line
             tarup the individual directory forming tarballs in the wrapper
             directory in the temp directory.
          4) Tarup the temporary wrapper directory for eventual inclusion
             in the generated installer.
          5) Generate the text of the "installer" script in the temporary
             directory customizing it with with options for specifying an
             overall prefix directory and individual prefixes for each of
             the directories specified on the mkinstaller command line.
          6) Add the tarball built in (4) to the end of the script generated
             in (5) forming the distribution self-extracting installation
             script in the directory where mkinstaller was run.
          7) Cleanup.

          In the end the only product is the desired distribution self-
          extracting installation script in the directory where the
          mkinstaller command was run. Everything else produced along the
          way (directories and files) is considered temporary and is
          destroyed.

          Note that the name of the installer is specified using the -c <name>
          or --create=<name> option to mkinstaller. However if the -c <name>
          or --create=<name> option is not used then mkinstaller will try
          to come-up with a reasonable name:

             1) If the --project-name=<name> and --project-version=<version>
                was used then the name of the generated installer will be:

                   <name>-<version>-installer

             2) If the --project-name=<name> was used but not the
                --project-version option the name of the generated
                installer will be:

                   <name>-installer

             3) If neither the --project-name nor the --project-version
                option the name of the generated installer will be:

                   installer

          As is typical for a UNIX-like environment, the generated script
          has no extension.

       How the generated installer script works on a UNIX-like target:

          1) The installer script locates itself. This may seem to be an
             obvious and or silly question but the actual location of the
             script file is necessary for the actual extraction (the script
             file must be read by the standard "tail" utility).
          2) Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
             done by the generated installer script is done in a temp
             directory. Creation of a top level temporary directory under
             which all other temporaries will be created. This temp
             directory is created under the standard temp directory
             determined at the start of this step (see NOTES).
          3) PREFIX and PREFIX_xxx values are established from command
             line options. If appropriate options aren't supplied to
             install all directories then the installer script will propmpt
             for the necessary pathname(s). The installer script will
             create the directories if necessary.
          4) The tarball embedded in the installer script is extracted from
             the installer script into the temp directory created in (2).
          5) The tarball in (4) is unwrapped revealing one or more tarballs
             (one for each installation directory such as bin.tar.gz/
             include.tar.gz/ lib.tar.gz/ ...). If a pre-install script was
             supplied to mkinstaller when the generated installer script
             was produced then it will be revealed at this time. Similarly
             if a post-install script was supplied to mkinstaller when the
             generated installer script was produced then it will also be
             revealed at this time. Note that neither of these scripts if
             supplied and revealed are actually executed in this step. See
             steps (6) and (8).
          6) If (5) revealed a pre-install script then it will be executed
             by the approptiate interpreter. Note that each of the PREFIX
             directories will be supplied as an option to this pre-install
             script (such as --prefix_bin=<pathname>). Also note at this time
             the individual tarballs representing the directories to install
             have NOT be unwrapped.
          7) Each individual tarball revealed in (5) is unwrapped into the
             approperiate PREFIX directory overlying anything already
             there.
          8) If (5) revealed a post-install script then it will be executed
             by the approptiate interpreter. Note that each of the PREFIX
             directories will be supplied as an option to this post-install
             script (such as --prefix_bin=<pathname>).
          9) Cleanup.

    Windows-like host

       On a Windows-like host (such as Windows 7) the generated installer
       is implemented as a binary execurable which is actually generated
       under the covers by NSIS (Nullsoft Scripted Install System).

       The installer construction process:

          1) Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
             done by the mkinstaller script is done in a temp directory.
          2) Generation of a .nsi script file.
          3) MakeNSIS is used to "compile" the .nsi script forming a
             .exe binary executable.

          The .exe binary executable formed in step (3) is the product of the
          mkinstaller script and may be shipped to customers to perform the
          desired installation on their Windows system.

          Note that the name of the installer is specified using the -c <name>
          or --create=<name> option to mkinstaller. However if the -c <name>
          or --create=<name> option is not used then mkinstaller will try
          to come-up with a reasonable name:

             1) If the --project-name=<name> and --project-version=<version>
                was used then the name of the generated installer will be:

                   <name>-<version>-installer.exe

             2) If the --project-name=<name> was used but not the
                --project-version option the name of the generated
                installer will be:

                   <name>-installer.exe

             3) If neither the --project-name nor the --project-version
                option the name of the generated installer will be:

                   installer.exe

          If the name is specified using the -c <name> or --create=<name>
          option then the name should NOT included a .exe extension. The
          makensis tool which actually produces the binary executable
          will add the necessary extension.

       Running the generated installer:

          -- The default use of the generated installer will produce a
             new directory on the user's desktop.

                prompt> installer.exe

          -- A different prefix may be specified using the /D option:

                prompt> installer.exe /D=E:ozoeposit

             Note that the prefix directory will be creates as necessary
             however the uninstaller will only (recursively delete) the
             final directory component. In the above example only
             E:ozoeposit will be (recursivly deleted, but the
             directory E:ozo will be left intact.

       Note that the generated installer will pop-up a progress bar dialog
       box to indicate the installation progress.

OPTIONS
    "mkinstaller" supports the following options:

        --copyright

            Output copyright and license info to <stdout> and quit.

        --help

            Output this man page to <stdout> and quit.

        --html <pathname>

            Output this man page as HTML to the given file pathname and quit.

        --vernum

            Output version number to <stdout> and quit.

        --version

            Output version number and revision date to <stdout> and quit.

        -c <name>
        --create=<name>

            The name of the script to generate. It is generally not advisable
            to include a suffix (aka. extension) as part of the script name.
            Also note that this is not a pathname, is is the simple name of
            the script file which is to be created in the current directory.
            By default the script will be named "installer".

        --cc=<string>

            The C compiler name and version number that had been used in
            building the software being installed. Note that the string
            is expected to a blank separated pair: the name and version
            number. The default is the string "- -" (meaning "unknown"
            or "don't care").

            Example:

            --cc="gcc 4.5.1"

        --cxx=<string>

            The C++ compiler name and version number that had been used
            in building the software being installed. Note that the string
            is expected to a blank separated pair: the name and version
            number. The default is the string "- -" (meaning "unknown"
            or "don't care").

            Example:

            --cxx="g++ 4.5.1"

        --contact=<address>

            A contact email address. There is no default contact address.

        -d
        --debug

            Produce extra output useful when debugging the "mkinstaller"
            script itself.

        --follow

            Follow symbolic links for directory pathnames to will be
            embedded as tarballs within the generated installer script.
            By default such symbolic links are not permitted.

            Note that Windows-like systems do not support symbolic-links.

        --fortran=<string>

            The FORTRAN compiler name and version number that had been
            used in building the software being installed. Note that the
            string is expected to a blank separated pair: the name and
            version number. The default is the string "- -" (meaning
            "unknown" or "don't care").

            Example:

            --fortran="gfortran 4.5.1"

        --nofollow

            Don't follow symbolic links for directory pathnames to will be
            embedded as tarballs within the generated installer script.
            When such symbolic-links are detected and error message will
            be produced and the script will terminate (after cleaning-up).
            This is the default behavior.

            Note that Windows-like systems do not support symbolic-links.

        --nonstd

            Don't bother with any search for standard directory names such
            as bin, lib, or include, (see the --std option). Instead just
            simply use the directory pathname as given. Note that such a
            search would only done when the given directory pathnames don't
            include those with standard base names as bin, lib, or include.

        --os=<string>

            The OS on the system on which the installer is being generated.
            This string is encoded in the installer script as an aid in
            determining if the generated script is applicable to the
            system where it is run. The default is to use uname -s and
            uname -r to determine this string.

        --postinstall-binary=<pathname>

            The pathname of a binary executable which is to be included
            with the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer after all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

        --postinstall-perl=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Perl script which is to be included with
            the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer after all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such post-install Perl scripts are not generally supported
            on Windows systems as Perl is not generally found on Windows
            systems.

        --postinstall-python=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Python script which is to be included with
            the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer after all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such post-install Python scripts are not generally supported
            on Windows systems as Perl is not generally found on Windows
            systems.

        --postinstall-sh=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Bourne-shell script which is to be included
            with the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer after all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such post-install Bourne-shell scripts are not generally
            supported on Windows systems as the Bourne-shell is not
            generally found on Windows systems.

        --preinstall-binary=<pathname>

            The pathname of a binary executable which is to be included
            with the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer before all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

        --preinstall-perl=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Perl script which is to be included with
            the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer before all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such pre-install Perl scripts are not generally supported
            on Windows systems as Perl is not generally found on Windows
            systems.

        --preinstall-python=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Python script which is to be included with
            the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer before all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such pre-install Python scripts are not generally supported
            on Windows systems as Perl is not generally found on Windows
            systems.

        --preinstall-sh=<pathname>

            The pathname of a Bourne-shell script which is to be included
            with the installer's payload. It will be run by the generated
            installer before all of the payload directories have been
            extracted and installed.

            Such pre-install Bourne-shell scripts are not generally
            supported on Windows systems as the Bourne-shell is not
            generally found on Windows systems.

        --prjnam=<name>
        --project-name=<name>

            The name of the project to be installed by the generated
            installer script. There is no default project name.

        --prjver=<A>.<B>[.<C>[.<D>]][<suffix>]
        --project-version=<A>.<B>[.<C>[.<D>]][<suffix>]

            The version number of the project to be installed by the
            generated installer script. Note that the given version number
            is expected to have 2, 3, or 4 dot-separated numeric components
            and an optional suffix. If the --project-version option is used
            then the --project-version option must also be used. There is
            no default project version number.

        --std

            If none of the given directory pathnames have basenames such
            as bin, lib, or include then look for immediate subdirectories
            of the given directory pathnames with such basenames. If any
            have such standard base names then replace the given directory
            pathname with all of the immediate subdirectory pathnames. See
            the --nonstd option.

        -v[<digit>]
        --verbose[<digit>]

            Operate in a verbose mode.

            Repeating this option increases the amount of output produced.
            Note that the option may end with an optional digit which
            indicates a repetition count. Thus the option:

               -v3

            is equavalent to:

               -v -v -v

        -w <pathname>
        --with-notice=<pathname>

            The pathname of a textfile which contains the copyright
            notice that is to be output by the generated installer script
            when the installer's --copyright option is used. By default
            the generated installer doesn't support a --copyright option.

        <pathname>

            The pathnames of one or more directories which will be
            embedded as tarballs within the generated installer script.
            Typical directory basenames are: bin, include, lib, ... Note
            that at least one such directory pathname is required.

            The basename of this pathname may not contain any spaces or
            tabs however the directory component (if any) may.

RETURNS
    "mkinstaller" returns the standard exit codes:

       0 -- success
       1 -- failure

ENVIRONMENT
    "mkinstaller" refers to the following environment variables:

        DEBUG_mkinstaller

            Generate extra output which is only usefull when debugging the
            "mkinstaller" script itself.

        INEFFECTIVE_mkinstaller

            If this environment variable has been set then the generated
            script will lack a payload and may not even be runable. Note
            that this feature is almost never used except when debugging
            the script generation process.

        MKINSTALLER_TMPDIR

            Consider this pathname before considering TMPDIR (see
            step (0) in the NOTES section below).

INPLEMENTATION
    "mkinstaller" is implemented as a Perl script.

SEE ALSO
    makensis(1), NSIS, sh(1), tar(1)

NOTES
    The directory where temporary files are to be placed is determined
    as follows:

        0) If MKINSTALLER_TMPDIR is defined and is not empty then
           consider its value as a directory pathname. If this pathname
           exists and is a directory and is writable then temporary
           files will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
        1) If TMPDIR is defined and is not empty then consider its
           value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
           and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
           will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
        2) If TMP is defined and is not empty then consider its
           value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
           and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
           will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
        3) If TEMP is defined and is not empty then consider its
           value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
           and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
           will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
        4) If the user's home directory can be determined and if
           this home directory contains a subdirectory named tmp
           that is itself writable then temporary files will be
           placed in this directory. Otherwise...
        5) If "C:<userProfile>\AppData\Local\temp" exists and
           is a writable directory then temporary files will be
           placed in this directory. Otherwise...
