=head1 NAME

edg-generate-sig - generate or find an EDG binary tarball version number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

edg-generate-sig --find[=verbose] [--no-fetch] [--ntries=N] [--progress] [COMMIT]

edg-generate-sig --generate=DIRECTORY

edg-generate-sig [--old] [COMMIT]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

End users do not generally have licenses for EDG source code. Therefore, the ROSE team compiles an EDG binary library
for most ROSE public releases.  EDG binary version numbers are SHA1 hashes that are generated from the parts of ROSE
upon which the EDG library depends.

This shell script fulfills three purposes:

=over

=item *

when called with "--find" it downloads the latest list of available EDG version numbers and tries to figure out
which one would work best for the specified commit.

=item *

when called with "--generate=DIRECTORY" it will scan the directory for EDG binary tarballs and build a manifest file for
end users.  This is normally only used by the ROSE team to update the download site.

=item *

when called without "--find" or "--generate" it calculates the EDG version number for the specied commit (default
HEAD).  This is normally only used by the ROSE team when building an EDG binary tarball.

=back

=head1 SWITCHES

=over

=item --find=verbose

Once can get more information about the commit that was used to generate the EDG binary by using "--find=verbose", which
causes the commit info to be emitted to standard error.  Multiple commits may have the same EDG binary version number,
in which case only the most recent matching commit (reachable from the one specified on the command-line) is shown.

=item --no-fetch

The "--no-fetch" switch prevents this script from trying to download the edg_binaries.txt file from the EDG binaries
server, and use the edg_binaries.txt already stored in the current working directory.

=item --generate=DIRECTORY

Generates a new manifest file by extracting version numbers from the EDG tarballs in the specified DIRECTORY.

=item --ntries=N

Controls how many commits should be checked to find a version.  The higher the number, the harder this script loooks for
a suitable version.  The default is 500.

=item --old

This script is able to generate old-style MD5 hashes that were once used by scripts/bincompat-sig.  These hashes are
much slower to compute because they do not use information already stored in Git tree objects. This switch is DEPRECATED.

=item --progress

Show progress on the stderr stream.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Since the EDG binary version number is computed from a Git commit, the version number will not reflect changes that the user
has not committed.  This applies to all files under the "util" and "src/ROSETTA" directories as well as the revision
of the EDG source code.

# Echo the SHA1 hash that represents the EDG binary library version number for the specified commit.  The EDG SHA1 hash
# is calculated by hashing the ls-tree lines for the things upon which EDG depends. Namely,
#   util                         - a tree object, whose SHA1 depends recursively on everything under it.
#   src/ROSETTA                  - ditto.
#   src/frontend/CxxFrontend/EDG - the EDG source code submodule; i.e., a commit SHA1 for the EDG source code.
#
# Note that the hash does *not* depend on everything that influences the EDG binary.  For instance, compiler options. Compiling
# with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG and without generate two incompatible EDG binaries, but they both have the same hash.
#
# Note that this list is *not* the same as was used in the original scripts/bincompat-sig. That script omitted "util".
# The current list comes from the src/frontend/CxxFrontend/Makefile.am, although we include all of ROSETTA instead of just
# ROSETTA/src because ROSETTA/src depends on some other stuff in ROSETTA.
#
# We use SHA1 for two reasons: first, the old bincompat-sig script used MD5, and since MD5 sums are a different size
# than SHA1 sums, we can tell the difference between how EDG binary library version number were created; second, we can
# generate SHA1 hashes via git without depending on the user having ancillary programs.
