# This test is used by the ROSE Automated Tester (RAT) to tag branch tips as passing or failing. It also serves as the
# canonical example of how to write a test script. All test scripts should refer to this documentation!
#
# Commands always use hyphens in their names and are meant to be called by users and can also be executed by other scripts.
# Functions always use underscores and are not intended to be called by users. A test script should be a command (thus the
# hyphen in its name) but they are also commonly executed by other scripts, most importantly rosegit-ats.
#
# You may assume that this script's current working directory is somewhere in the build tree.  When it's called by rosegit-ats
# the cwd will always be the top of the build tree.
#
# Any kind of progress information that you want to appear on stdout of rosegit-ats should be sent to file descriptor 6.
# Keep progress info short and to the point!  When a test is run by rosegit-ats, rosegit-ats redirects file descriptor 6 to
# the output and saves this scripts standard out and error to a log file which will become the basis for an error report in
# the event of a failure. On the other hand, when you run this script interactively you probably don't care about progress
# reports and they just get thrown away.  Here's some ways you could redirect output (assuming you're not using a brain-dead
# shell):
#
#       rat-test 6>&1 >saved.outout 2>&1         # save output, show progress
#       rat-test 6>&1                            # show progress along with output
#       rat-test                                 # show output, toss progress
#

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every test script starts with these lines to set up the build environment. This takes care of all the ways this script
# can be called (from rosegit-ats or interactively, from the top of a build tree or deep inside a build tree, with an
# environment already set up or not, etc.)

# rosegit_run is a convenient way to run a command since it emits some progress information and statistics. The first argument
# is the progress message and the remaining arguments are the command. If the command has meta characters you can enclose the
# entire command in quotes, or enclose individual arguments in quotes.

rosegit_run "build"          "(cd $ROSE_SRC && ./build)"            	|| exit 1
rosegit_run "configure"      "(cd $ROSE_BLD && $ROSEGIT_CONFIGURE)" 	|| exit 1
rosegit_run "make"           "(cd $ROSE_BLD && rosegit_make)"       	|| exit 1
rosegit_run "make distcheck" "(cd $ROSE_BLD && rosegit_make distcheck)" || exit 1

# Or you can just run your own commands and generate your own progress messages...

#echo "test completed" >&6                        # this is a progress report
#echo "$myname: test completed successfully."     # this is normal output
