         DESCRIPTION
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
         This script is used to generate an "installer" script implemented as
         a Bourne-shell script on UNIX-like systems (such as Linux, MacOS, or
         Solaris) or as a binary executable on Windows-like systems. A wide
         assortment of options are provided by <i>mkinstaller</i> to specify what is
         to be included for installation by the generated installer script.
         This generated installer itself supports a number of options for
         specifying the where the various directories are to be installed
         (prefix directory pathnames).
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
         There are 2 separate computer systems involved in this process:
         <blockquote>
            <ol>
               <li>The <b>source</b> system. This is where the software to be installed
                   is found and where the <i>mkinstaller</i> script (the generator) is
                   used. On Windows-like hosts the <i>NSIS</i> software package must
                   have been properly installed on the <b>source</b> system.
               </li>
               <li>The <b>target</b> system. This is where the generated installer
                   script is run, where the software is to be installed. Note
                   that the <i>NSIS</i> software package is NOT required on the "target"
                   system.
               </li>
            </ol>
         </blockquote>
         There are 3 pieces of software involved:
         <blockquote>
            <ol>
               <li>The software to be installed. This is the software (binaries
                   and/or text) located on the <b>source</b> system whose components
                   have been built and is deemed ready for distribution.
               </li>
               <li>The <i>mkinstaller</i> script. Note that on a Windows-like host
                   the <i>NSIS</i> software must be properly installed. The <i>mkinstaller</i>
                   script required <i>NSIS</i> to generate the desired installer. <i>NSIS</i>
                   will NOT be required on the <b>target</b> system.
               </li>
               <li>The generated installer script. On a UNIX-like host this is
                   a Bourne-shell script generated by the <i>mkinstaller</i> script.
                   On a Windows-like host this is a binary executable (a <b><big><code>.exe</code></big></b>
                   file) that is generated by the <i>mkinstaller</i> script using the
                   <i>NSIS</i> package under the covers.
               </li>
            </ol>
         </blockquote>
         There are 4 distinct phases or times involved in this process:
         <blockquote>
            <ol>
               <li><b>Build-time</b>. This is the time when the software (binaries
                   and/or text files) is built and installed on the <b>source</b> system.
                   How this software is built and installed is not discussed here.
               </li>
               <li><b>Generation-time</b>. This is the time when <i>mkinstaller</i> is used
                   to collect the software that was produced in phase 1 and generate
                   the installer script. Like phase 1, this is also done on the
                   <b>source</b> system.
               </li>
               <li><b>Transport</b>. This is the process of taking a copy of the
                   generated installer script that was produced in phase 2 from
                   the <b>source</b> system to the <b>target</b> system. The details of this
                   are not discussed here however such transport generally
                   involves <i>scp</i>, <i>ftp</i>, <i>curl</i>, CD, DVD, USB-drive, or a download from
                   a web site.
               </li>
               <li><b>Installation-time</b>. this is the time when the installer
                   script that was generated by <i>mkinstaller</i> in phase 2 is executed
                   on the <b>target</b> system.
               </li>
            </ol>

      <blockquote>
         <b>UNIX-like Host</b>
         <blockquote>
            On a UNIX-like host such as Linux, MacOS, or Solaris the generated
            installer script is implemented as a self-extracting Bourne-shell
            script carrying a tarball as a payload. Note that <i>mkinstaller</i>
            requires <i>tar</i> on UNIX-like hosts. This is normally not a problem
            as almost every UNIX-like system provides <i>tar</i>. On some UNIX-like
            hosts (most notably Solaris) <i>tar</i> doesn't support compression. On
            such systems mkinstaller will require <i>gzcat</i> and <i>gzip</i> to support
            compression.
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            The installation process on a UNIX-like target system is done by
            simply running the generated installer script using the <b><big><code>--prefix</code></big></b>
            option to supply the installation directory. For example:
            <blockquote>
                <b><big><code>./banana-installer -v --prefix=/opt/banana</code></big></b>
            </blockquote>
            Note that on UNIX-like hosts the <b><big><code>--prefix=</code></big></b><i>pathname</i> option isn't
            really optional, it is required. Also note that use of the <b><big><code>-v</code></big></b>
            option (verbose mode) is recommended as the generated installer
            normally produces no output other than remarks, warnings, and/or
            error messages.
         </blockquote>
         <b>Windows-like Host</b>
         <blockquote>
            On a Windows-like host (such as Windows 7 or Windows 10) the
            generated installer is implemented as a binary executable which
            is actually generated under the covers by <i>NSIS</i> (Nullsoft Scripted
            Install System). <i>NSIS</i> is required by <i>mkinstaller</i> on Windows-like
            hosts. Note that <i>NSIS</i> is open source and is freely available at:
            <blockquote>
               <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis"><b><big><code>https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis</code></big></b></a>
            </blockquote>
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            The installation process on a Windows-like target system is done by
            simply running the generated installer binary executable. Unlike an
            installer produced for UNIX-like hosts, an installer for Windows-like
            hosts may perform the installation to a default location; the user's
            desktop:
            <blockquote>
              <b><big><code>banana-installer.exe</code></big></b>
            </blockquote>
            When run the installer executable puts-up a dialog box resembling:
            <blockquote>
               <center>
                  <img src="../../images/mkinstaller/installer-dialog.png">
                  <p>
                     Typical installation dialog box
               </center>
            </blockquote>
            The installation dialog box allows the user to specify the installation
            "prefix" directory by replacing the default pathname with the desired
            pathname or using the browser button to locate and select a pathname.
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            To specify an installation prefix on the command line the <b><big><code>/D=</code></big></b><i>pathname</i>
            option may be used:
            <blockquote>
              <b><big><code>banana-installer.exe /D=E:\opt\banana</code></big></b>
            </blockquote>

               The name of the script to generate. It is generally not advisable
               to include a suffix (aka. extension) as part of the script name.
               Also note that this is <i>not</i> a pathname, is is the simple name of
               the script file which is to be created in the current directory.
               By default the script will be named "installer".

            <blockquote>
               Note that there are 2 forms accepted for the option's argument:

                  <li> A simple C compiler name such as <i>gcc</i> or <i>icc</i>. This is the
                       name of the C compiler that was used to produce the binaries

                       </blockquote>
                       In this case the <i>gcc</i> GNU C compiler was used to produce the
                       binaries (executables and libraries). Note that if <i>name</i> has
                       directory components only the basename will be used.

                       used to produce the binaries to be installed. The second
                       component is a name by which the compiler will be considered.
                       For example:

            The <b><big><code>-c</code></big></b> <i>name</i> option is used to give a meaningful name to the

            On a UNIX-like host the generated installer script is implemented

            <blockquote>
               Aside from initialization and command line processing the UNIX
               implementation of <i>mkinstaller</i> goes through the following steps:
               <ol>
                  <li>Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
                      done by the <i>mkinstaller</i> script is done in a temp directory.
                  </li>
                  <li>Creation of a top level temporary directory under which all
                      other temporaries will be created. Creation of an "accumulator",
                      an "intermediate" and a "wrapper" directory in the top level
                      temp directory. A tarup/untar process will use both the
                      "intermediate" and "accumulator" directories to merge given
                      directories with the same basename. The "wrapper" directory
                      will be used to carry the individual directory tarballs.
                  </li>
                  <li>From each of the specified directories to be installed such
                      as .../bin, .../lib, specified on the <i>mkinstaller</i> command line
                      tarup the individual directory forming tarballs in the wrapper
                      directory in the temp directory.
                  </li>
                  <li>Tarup the temporary wrapper directory for eventual inclusion
                      in the generated installer.
                  </li>
                  <li>Generate the text of the "installer" script in the temporary
                      directory customizing it with with options for specifying an
                      overall prefix directory and individual prefixes for each of
                      the directories specified on the <i>mkinstaller</i> command line.
                  </li>
                  <li>Add the tarball built in (4) to the end of the script generated
                      in (5) forming the distribution self-extracting installation
                      script in the directory where <i>mkinstaller</i> was run.

                  <li>Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
                      done by the generated installer script is done in a temp
                      directory. Creation of a top level temporary directory under
                      which all other temporaries will be created. This temp
                      directory is created under the standard temp directory
                      determined at the start of this step (see NOTES).

                  <li><b><big><code>PREFIX</code></big></b> and <b><big><code>PREFIX_</code></big></b><i>xxx</i> values are established from command
                      line options. If appropriate options aren't supplied to
                      install all directories then the installer script will prompt
                      for the necessary pathname(s). The installer script will
                      create the directories if necessary.

                  <li>The tarball embedded in the installer script is extracted from
                      the installer script into the temp directory created in (2).
                  </li>
                  <li>The tarball in (4) is unwrapped revealing one or more tarballs
                      (one for each installation directory such as <b><big><code>bin.tar.gz</code></big></b>
                      <b><big><code>include.tar.gz</code></big></b> <b><big><code>lib.tar.gz</code></big></b> ...). If a pre-install script was
                      supplied to <i>mkinstaller</i> when the generated installer script
                      was produced then it will be revealed at this time. Similarly
                      if a post-install script was supplied to <i>mkinstaller</i> when the
                      generated installer script was produced then it will also be
                      revealed at this time. Note that neither of these scripts if
                      supplied and revealed are actually executed in this step. See
                      steps (6) and (8).

                      directories to install have NOT be unwrapped.

                  <li>Each individual tarball revealed (5) is unwrapped into the

            On a Windows-like host (such as Windows 7 or 10) the generated
            installer is implemented as a binary executable which is actually
            generated under the covers by <i>NSIS</i> (the Nullsoft Scripted Install).

            <b>Details of the installer construction process on Windows:</b>
            <blockquote>
               Aside from initialization and command line processing the Windows
               implementation of <i>mkinstaller</i> goes through the following steps:
               <ol>
                  <li>Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
                      done by the <i>mkinstaller</i> script is done in a temp directory.
                  </li>
                  <li>Generation of a <b><big><code>.nsi</code></big></b> script file.
                  </li>
                  <li><i>MakeNSIS</i> is used to "compile" the <b><big><code>.nsi</code></big></b> script forming a
                      <b><big><code>.exe</code></big></b> binary executable.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               The <b><big><code>.exe</code></big></b> binary executable formed in step (3) is the product of the
               <i>mkinstaller</i> script and may be shipped to customers to perform the
               desired installation on their Windows system.

            <blockquote>
               Note that the name of the installer is specified using the <b><big><code>-c</code></big></b> <i>name</i>
               or <b><big><code>--create=</code></big></b><i>name</i> option to <i>mkinstaller</i>. However if the <b><big><code>-c</code></big></b> <i>name</i>
               or <b><big><code>--create=</code></big></b><i>name</i> option is not used then <i>mkinstaller</i> will try
               to come-up with a reasonable name:

                         was used then the name of the generated installer will resemble:

                  </ol>
               </blockquote>
               If the name is specified using the <b><big><code>-c</code></big></b> <i>name</i> or <b><big><code>--create=</code></big></b><i>name</i>
               option then the name should NOT included a <b><big><code>.exe</code></big></b> extension. The
               <i>makensis</i> tool which actually produces the binary executable
               will add the necessary extension.

            <b>Running the generated installer on a Windows target system:</b>
            <blockquote>
               The default use of the generated installer will produce a new
               directory on the user's desktop.
               <blockquote>
                  bigtop> <b><big><code>installer.exe</code></big></b>
               </blockquote>
               A different prefix may be specified using the <b><big><code>/D</code></big></b> option:
               <blockquote>
                  bigtop> <b><big><code>installer.exe /D=E:\opt\banana</code></big></b>
               </blockquote>
               Note that the prefix directory will be creates as necessary
               however the uninstaller will only (recursively) delete the
               final directory component. In the above example only
               <b><big><code>E:\opt\banana</code></big></b> will be (recursively deleted, but the
               directory <b><big><code>E:\opt</code></big></b> will be left intact.

            <blockquote>
               Note that the generated installer will pop-up a progress bar dialog
               box to indicate the installation progress. The above examples were
