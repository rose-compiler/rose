              <i>
              This paper presents a novel technique to detect data races and deadlocks of OpenMP programs, using hybrid program analysis. Specifically, we use an
              SMT-solver based static analysis to analyze
              OpenMP source code. Then we use a dynamic analysis to confirm, or rule out, the potential errors. The static analysis narrows down the code regions and
              events that need to be monitored, significantly reducing the overhead of the dynamic analysis. Our experiments show that OpenMP-Checker is more scalable and accurate
              at pinpointing concurrency errors within a set of chosen benchmarks, compared to the two commercial tools, Sun Thread Analyzer and Intel Thread Checker.

              This paper presents a compiler based transformation released in ROSE and demonstrates 
              the use of Triple Modular Redundancy as an approach to provide HPC software with fault tolerance against 
              transient faults, as we expect them to manifest themselves on future Exascale architectures.  The paper presents
              performance results showing that for a randomly selected subset of benchmarks the overhead of this extra
              layer of support is about 20%.  We expect that may be competitive with future approaches to fault tolerance
              using check-point restart that may be much more expensive or maybe even intractable for Exascale.  This work is
              released as a framework within ROSE to support research work in this area by ourselves and collaborators.

              This paper presents an auto-scoping algorithm to work with OpenMP tasks. (Auto-scoping is the process of automatically determining the data sharing dependencies
              of variables in OpenMP programs). This is a much more complex challenge due to the uncertainty of when a task
              will be executed, which makes it harder to determine what parts of the program will run concurrently. We also introduce an implementation of the algorithm and
              results with several benchmarks showing that the algorithm is able to correctly scope a large percentage of the variables appearing in them.

              <i>
              This paper presents an extensive study of the impact of application level optimizations on both the performance and power efficiencies of applications from a wide range
              of scientific and embedded systems domains. We observe that application-level optimizations often have a much larger impact on performance than on power consumption. However,
              optimizing for performance does not necessarily lead to better power consumption, and vice versa. Compared to sequential applications, multithreaded applications give more
              room for performance and power improvements. Additionally, a number of optimizations, including loop and thread affinity optimizations, have shown great potential in
              supporting collective enhancement of both performance and power efficiency. Our experimental results provide several insights to help exploit these optimizations effectively.
