This is a Demo of ROSE that can be run by any user, the 
details and the explainations are represnetative of pieces
of work specific to our general software analysis owrk in ROSE.

Introduction to ROSE:
   ROSE is a framework for building tools that can regenerate the
software (source code and binary), and which permits modifications 
along the way


How to run a demo of ROSE:

BinQ is a testing ground for forms of binary analysis which are later is moved to Compass.

0) Run Robb's example.

0.5) ROSE works on ARM (Elf), PowerPC (Elf), and x86 (Elf and PE)
    Show disassembly of ARM (Elf) and x86 (PE)
    We will see x86 (Elf) and PowerPC else later in the demo.


1) Binary Analysis Demo (running separate forms of analysis)

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/BinQ:

   show the source code so the problem is more clear.
   Run "make demo_show_source_code"

   Run "make demo_withoutAnalysisRunInBatchMode"
   (running the "Binary Call Graph" analysis will generate "callgraph.dot")
   (running the "Control Flow Graph" analysis will generate "cfg.dot")
   (running the "Data Flow Graph" analysis will generate "dfg.dot")

   Run zgrviewer on "callgraph.dot" to see the call graph.
     Colors: (???)
     Note that main is not called directly since "__lib_start_main()" calls "main" and we
     don't see the dynamically linked library functions in the dynamic library.

   Run zgrviewer on "cfg.dot" to see the control flow graph.
     Colors: Yellow (normal instructions)
             Green nodes and edges (conditional branches) 
             Dark Purple (Functions starts)
             Light Purple nodes (function calls and returns)
             Blue edges (returns)
             Red edges (calls)
             Yellow edges (next instruction in sequence without control flow)

   Run zgrviewer on "dfg.dot" to see the data flow graph.
     Colors of edges are the same as in the CFG.
     Yellow nodes (unreachable instructions; as computed using intra-procedural 
            analysis; inter-procedural analysis is more complex and not demo'd)
     Red nodes (Moves into memory; e.g. non-register moves)
     Green (all other nodes)



2) Binary analysis Demo (buffer overflow):

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/BinQ:
   Run "make demo_withAnalysisRunInBatchMode"

   This demo runs a predefined (hard coded) collection of analysis algorithms as part of
   the startup: 
      Running analysis : Binary Dynamic Info
      Running analysis : Data Flow Graph
      Running analysis : Forbidden Function Call
      Running analysis : Forbidden Function Call   time : 0.001724   Problems : 0
      Running analysis : Malloc needs Free
 Found malloc in function main
Running analysis : Malloc needs Free   time : 0.001513   Problems : 1
   malloc() called but no free() found:  (  4004bc) : call   0x4003e0  <malloc> <malloc>  in function: main
Running analysis : Null After Free
Running analysis : Null After Free   time : 0.00143099   Problems : 0
Running analysis : Init Pointer to Null
Running analysis : Init Pointer to Null   time : 0.0015769   Problems : 0
Running analysis : Complexity Metric
Running analysis : Complexity Metric   time : 0.00144196   Problems : 0
Running analysis : Buffer Overflow Analysis
Dataflow analysis run before ... 
Running analysis : Buffer Overflow Analysis   time : 0.0040741   Problems : 1


   This demo shows to properties of the binary:
     1) A "malloc" in "main" has no associated "free"
     2) A buffer overflow of the array allocted by the malloc
        The access of the 12th array element exceeds the size of the length 10 array.
        The checker reports that the byte 48 exceeds the bound of the array at byte 40.
     3) This demo also shows that we can associate function name with function calls
        See that function call at address 4004bc is a call to "malloc"
        This analysis is done by the "BinaryDynamicInfo"

     4) Note that forbidden function analysis searches for the existance of the following
        functions:
           "vfork"
           "sprintf"
           "scanf"
           "sscanf"
           "gets"
           "strcpy"
           "_mbscpy"
           "lstrcat"
           "memcpy"
           "strcat"
           "rand"
           "rewind"
           "atoi"
           "atol"
           "atoll"
           "atof"

2.5) Build a binary and test the forbidden function analysis 


3) More complex buffer overflow:
    
   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/BinQ:
   Run "make demo_rted_example"

   This demo demonstrates a buffer overflow that we can not presently detect.
   The malloc of size "sizeof(int)+1" is permitting the last 3 bytes of the
   4 byte access of the 2nd element of the array of 4 byte integers to overflow.
   A more sophisticated analysis is required to interpret the type and detect that
   the last 3 byts of the 4 byte array access is a buffer overflow.

   Requires type analysis.


4) Comparing ROSE vs. IDAPro (on same 32-bit example)

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/BinQ:
   Run "make demo_rose_vs_IDAPro"

   Notice that the disassembly using ROSE is slightly different. This work uses
   a database of the results from IDA Pro built as part of collaborations with 
   other researchers. This demo does not run IDA Pro, that data based was previously 
   constructed.  In this demo the "Binary Dynamic Info" analysis can be run to 
   fill in names of functions (e.g. the call to "malloc" in main).


5) Compass on binary file (test mode):
    There are three binary specific checkers in compass:
     1) Statics on instruction frequency
     2) Unparser (for instructions)
     3) Loop detectors (on binary)

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/compass/tools/compass:
   a) Run "make demo_small"

   This runs compass on the compass binary (about 100K in size, not stripped).
   the output is in text form to support general handling of detected violations or
   detected software features.

   b) Run "make demo_linux"
      This demo is running the linux "ls" command (about 80K in size, stripped)

     
   Output from running Compass (without the GIU interface)
      Fragments of some of the output presents is:
      Instruction frequency (make demo_linux):

6) Compass on source code using GUI interface:

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/compass/tools/compass:
   a) Run "make demo_compassGUI"

6.5) Compass on binary using GUI interface:

   In directory:
  /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2-QRose/projects/compass/tools/compass:
   a) Run "make demo_compassGUI"

      Within the GUI click on the "regenerate" button at the top and then the "refresh" botton.

      At present this fails with an error:
         Exception: out of memory
         Exception: database is not open

6.8) Show construction of checker (using gen_checker.sh).
    This checker has default behavior, but is a valid check that can be filled in with
    vulnerability specific analysis, use existing analysis, etc.

7) Removed

8) Demo of binary file compare:
    In directory:
    /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2/developersScratchSpace/Dan/astEquivalence_tests

    Run "make testBinaryEquivalence"

    This demo evaluates the differences between to binaries generated from the same source
    file, one with debugging information and the other without any debugging information.

    tux270.llnl.gov{dquinlan}157: ls -l testProgram_?
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 dquinlan overture 7967 Jan 16 18:44 testProgram_1
    -rwxrwxr-x  1 dquinlan overture 6551 Jan 16 18:44 testProgram_2

    This test looks only at the binary file structure and not the instructions
    (a later demo will look only at the instructions, using BinQ).

    This test will use a classic tree edit distance algorithm (written and optimized by
    the ROSE team) to determine the minimum additions and deletion to make any to files
    (typically different files) the same. The demo generates a file called "output.dot"
    which can be visualized using zgrviewer.  the generated file is a large graph which
    take 20 minutes to layout using dot, but shows the details edits required to translate
    one file into the other. 


9) Compass on large projects:

   In directory:
   /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2/projects/compass/tools/compass/gui

   Run "make demo"

   This demo shows how a data base is built (before running Compass) and then Compass.
   The database stores the commandline require to compile source code.  The compass is
   run using the database as input.  Click "regenerate" and "refresh" to display the 
   results.  The "regenerate" button will run compass on all the items in the 
   database, this can take a little while (a few seconds in the demo on a fast machine).
   Then the "refresh" button will sort and display the results.  Clicking on a specific
   rule (from the list in the upper left window), will cause the locations of violations 
   of that rule to be displayed in the upper center window.  Clicking on an entry in the 
   upper center window causes the lower windows to load that specific file and highlight
   the line in the file where the violation occured.  Currently both binaries and source
   code work in Compass, but the GUI handles the source code better, this will become 
   more uniform in time.

***** What is different between this demo and #8 ??? (they are the same, #8 is a subset of #10)
10) AST Equivalence:

   In directory:
   /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2/developersScratchSpace/Dan/astEquivalence_tests

   Run "make demoSourceEquivalence"

   This builds the edit distance graph for two source codes (independent of variable
   names, source code formatting, etc.).  A visualization of the edit graph on the 
   structure of the file is shown using zgrviewer.

   Run "make demoBinaryEquivalence"

   This demo generates the edit graph for two similar binary files (one
   compiled with debug and the other without), and displays a pre-generated
   image of a visualization of the a quadrant of the whole graph (takes 
   20+ minutes to layout in dot so the image has been pre-computed).

11) Static rewritting demo

   In directory:
   /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2/developersScratchSpace/Dan/translator_tests

   Run "make demo"

   This demo shows the additon of a named section to an existing binary file.  The to
   support this the section table of names is edited and an additional name added, this
   causes the entire binary to be offset by the length of the name (and it's null
   terminator).  A new secton is added to the binary with some random data. All the 
   stored offets in the binary must be recomputed and reset as part of the final
   regeneration of the binary as and excutable with extra data.

   The binary equivalence test is used to test the original and the modified binary.
   The edit distance it isolated to a single point in the AST (excerpt of output).
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 10562 to_label = 10727 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 10397 to_label = 10562 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 10232 to_label = 10397 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 10067 to_label = 10232 
     editOperation = insertion from_label = 10066 to_label = 10067 
     editOperation = insertion from_label = 10065 to_label = 10066 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 9900 to_label = 10065 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 9735 to_label = 9900 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 9570 to_label = 9735 
     editOperation = substitution from_label = 9405 to_label = 9570

   The dot file visualization representing the edit graph is 6Meg and too large to 
   layout using dot.


12) Binary File Format (ELF, PE, and DOS)

    In directory:
    /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/svn-LINUX-64bit-4.2.2/developersScratchSpace/Dan/Disassembler_tests

    Run "make demo"
   
    This demo will generate the AST associated with a Windows executable,
    from the AST we can generate a listing of all the information (logoff.exe.dump),
    the graph of the AST (logoff.exe.dot), the graph of the AST plus additional
    connections (logoff_WholeAST.dot) and the reassembled binary which is verified
    (via bytewise comparision) to be identical.

    Then zgrviewer logoff_WholeAST.dot &

    and zgrviewer logoff.exe.dot &

    In the AST it is interesting to note that there are two SgAsmInterpretation subtrees.
    This is because Windows binaires have a DOS part (header, section, etc.) which is 
    interpreted in 16-bit mode during disassemble and analysis and a 32-bit Windows part
    (with a header and many sections, etc.).  It is critical to get the interpretation
    of these different parts of the binary correct since 16-bit interpreation is
    fundamentally different from a 32-bit interpretation.  Other binary file formats 
    can contain many more than 2 interpretations (e.g. Mac OSX binaries, which we do 
    not presently support).

    Looking at logoff.exe.dump (text file), shows the details of the section data 
    and instructions available internally in the AST.
