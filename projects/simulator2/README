Linux x86/amd64 simulator. See "x86sim --help" for usage.

== Intructuction ==

x86sim is a simulator for linux-x86 and linux-amd64. It's composed of
three main parts:

1. ROSE's instruction semantics layer simulates the execution of each
   instruction.  The simulator uses ConcreteSemantics2.h and overrides
   a few of the RISC operators in order to do things like intercepting
   system calls.  This part of the simulator is relatively small and
   simple since most of the code is part of the ROSE library itself.

2. The simulator emulates certain parts of the Linux operating system
   such as process and thread abstractions, signal delivery, memory
   management (mmap and friends), segment registers and the global and
   local descriptor tables, fast user-space mutexes (futexes), process
   loading (exec), system call dispatching, etc.

3. The simulator provides a framework for interacting with the
   simulated guest executable, mostly by registering callbacks that
   are triggered at certain points of execution. For instance, the
   simulator's interactive debugger is implemented entirely from
   callbacks.

== Definitions ==

The "guest" consists of a binary "specimen" whose instructions are
being simulated, and a simulated Linux "guest OS".

The "host" is the simulator itself running on the "host OS".

The guest and host need not be the same architecture. E.g., it's
possible to run 32-bit guest specimen in a simulated 32-bit guest OS
all running in a 64-bit version of ROSE. The 32-bit host is not well
tested at this time, and running a 64-bit guest in a 32-bit host has
not been tested at all yet [2015-06-29].

== Initial program load ==

x86sim can completely emulate the Linux loader, or it can initialize
itself from a native Linux load (the latter is currently only
implemented for 64-bit guests on a 64-bit host [2015-06-29]).
The emulated load is the default.

The native load is triggered by specifying "--native-load" and works
by starting the specimen natively in a debugger and breaking at its
first instruction.  The simulators memory and registers are
initialized from the stopped specimen and then the native specimen is
killed before the simulator continues.  For reproducible results with
native loading you'll probably want to run the native-loading
simulator inside "x86_64 -R" or "i386 -R" to turn off address
randomization.

== Linux virtual dynamic shared object (VDSO) ==

Linux programs are linked with an ELF library provided by the
kernel. For 32-bit programs this is linux-gate.so and for 64-bit
programs it's linux-vdso.so.  The vdso contains, among other things,
the mechanism for the guest to make system calls.

For a native load, the VDSO becomes part of the emulated process
automatically.  For native loads a VDSO can be specified with the
"--vdso" command-line switch. Currently [2015-06-29] a VDSO is
required for 64-bit guests and causes problems for 32-bit guests.

Since the VDSO is not stored in the filesystem, but rather comes from
the kernel, you must get a copy of it when using emulated
loading. There are many ways to do this, and here's one way using the
simulator:

1. Choose some benign executable with the same architecture as the
   specimen you're interested in loading.  For example, you could use
   "/bin/cat".

2. Run /bin/cat in the simulator with the interactive debugger
   enabled and using native loading.

   $ x86_64 -R ./x86sim --arch=linux-amd64 --debugger --native-load /bin/cat

3. In the debugger, print the memory map and look for the entry with
   "vdso" in its name:

    RSIM> memory
    va 0x00400000 + 0x0000c000 = 0x0040c000 r-x- at buffer aaa   + 0x00000000 proc:9461(/bin/cat)
    va 0x0060c000 + 0x00001000 = 0x0060d000 rw-- at buffer aab   + 0x00000000 proc:9461(/bin/cat)
    va 0x00007ffff7ddf000 + 0x0001e000 = 0x00007ffff7dfd000 r-x- at buffer aac   + 0x00000000 proc:9461(/lib/ld-2.11.3.so)
    va 0x00007ffff7ffb000 + 0x00001000 = 0x00007ffff7ffc000 r-x- at buffer aad   + 0x00000000 proc:9461([vdso])
    va 0x00007ffff7ffc000 + 0x00002000 = 0x00007ffff7ffe000 rw-- at buffer aae   + 0x00000000 proc:9461(/lib/ld-2.11.3.so)
    va 0x00007ffff7ffe000 + 0x00001000 = 0x00007ffff7fff000 rw-- at buffer aaf   + 0x00000000 proc:9461()
    va 0x00007ffffffe9000 + 0x00016000 = 0x00007ffffffff000 rw-- at buffer aag   + 0x00000000 proc:9461([stack])

4. Dump the vdso section to a file, then quit the simulator. There
   must be no white space around the "+".

    RSIM> memory dump linux-vdso.so 0x00007ffff7ffb000+0x00001000
    RSIM> quit

5. Now use this file when doing emulated loading:

   $ ./x86sim .... --vdso=linux-vdso.so ....

== Process and thread model ==

The simulator runs each guest process in a separate simulator process,
and each guest thread in its own simulator thread.  Since the guest
process and threads are being simulated they don't have their own
Linux process and threads. Any system calls performed by the host on
behalf of the guest are actually operating on the host process and
threads.  This can lead to some subtle behavior:

* Attaching to a guest's process with a debugger like GDB will
  actually be attaching to the simulator instead.

* The guest and host share all file descriptors. Although the
  simulator keeps guest and host file descriptors separated and
  keeps a mapping between guest and host descriptors, they initially
  share file descriptors for standard input, output, and error.

* If the guest accesses the "/proc/<pid>/" filesystem on Linux it will
  be accessing information about the simulator, not itself.

* Sending a signal to a host process or thread may or may not cause the
  signal to be forwarded to the guest process or thread.

* The simulator is multi-threaded C++ program even if the guest is a
  single threaded C program.

== System calls ==

All attempts by the guest to execute a system call need to be
intercepted by the simulator, marshaled from simulated guest memory to
host memory, a system call performed by the host on behalf of the
guest, and then the results marshaled back to the simulated
memory. For a 32-bit guest running on a 64-bit host there's additional
translation steps as part of the marshaling.

Only the most common system calls are implemented, but the mechanism
allows users to implement their own.  Here's how:

Lets say you get the simulator error "syscall_22(...) is not
implemented".  So you look for "22" in /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h
(or unistd_32.h depending on your guest's architecture) and find that
it's the "access" system call.  As a rough approximation you can look
at the documentation for "access" in section 2 of the man pages, but
this will document the "access" function in the C library, not the
syscall. Usually they're mostly the same, the your canonical reference
is to find the system call function in the Linux kernel source code.

Your next task is to write at least two functions to handle the
"access" call: one for printing the function call name and its
arguments, and one for doing the actual system call on behalf of the
guest. A third function to print results is optional.

Here's the function to print the syscall name and arguments. The "s"
and "f" methods are for walking through the argument list where "s"
prints a string (the file name) and "f" prints the flags. The "TF" and
"T_END" are macros defined in RSIM_Common.h:

    void
    syscall_access_enter(RSIM_Thread *t, int callno) {
	static const Translate flags[] = { TF(R_OK), TF(W_OK), TF(X_OK), TF(F_OK), T_END };
	t->syscall_enter("access").s().f(flags);
    }

Here's the function to do the actual work on behalf of the guest:

    void
    syscall_access_body(RSIM_Thread *t, int callno) {
	rose_addr_t nameVa = t->syscall_arg(0);
	bool error;
	std::string name = t->get_process()->read_string(nameVa, 0, &error);
	if (error) {
	    t->syscall_return(-EFAULT);
	    return;
	}
	int mode = t->syscall_arg(1);
	int result = access(name.c_str(), mode);
	if (-1 == result)
	    result = -errno;
	t->syscall_return(result);
    }

Finally, one needs to register these two functions with the simulator
so they get called whenever system call 22 is needed. The "sim" is
your simulator object, and syscall_default_leave is the function to
supply when there's nothing special to do for printing the syscall
return value:

    sim.syscall_define(22, syscall_access_enter, syscall_access_body,
                       RSIM_Linux::syscall_default_leave)

== fork (clone) and exec system calls ==

The simulator is always multi-threaded even when the guest has a
single thread. In order to simulate a fork on behalf of the guest, the
simulator needs to call fork() natively, but calling fork in a
multi-threaded program is fraught with danger.  See this blog for a
good description
[http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/threads-and-fork-think-twice-before-using-them].

In short, the problem is that fork() can interrupt threads in the
parent process while they're executing in critical sections, and that
the only functions safe to call in the child process are async signal
safe functions (which excludes things like I/O, memory allocation,
etc.). Unfortunately, the simulator needs to continue simulating guest
instructions in the child after fork returns, which involves lots more
than just async-signal safe functions!

It's theoretically possible to use pthread_atfork to handle these
cases, but this is is hard to do correctly and we still don't have
guarantees that libraries used by ROSE are doing it right even if ROSE
is. Besides, the Boost thread library, which we're using for
portability, does not have an equivalent function.

== Interactive debugger ==

The simulator has a built-in interactive debugger that gets triggered
when the simulator is run with the "--debugger" switch. It will break
before executing the first guest instruction (BTW, the earliest GDB
can break is after executing the first instruction).

The GNU readline is used for entering commands if ROSE was configured
with "--with-readline", otherwise commands cannot be edited (other
than backspace) and there is no command-history.

The debugger was written mainly to help the simulator developer fix
bugs in instruction semantics and system call handling. It has no
documentation or help system other than this file and the source
code. At this time [2015-06-29] the commands are as follows, many of
which have aliases.

In the descriptions below, INTERVAL is either a single integer, or a
base and size separated by "+" (no intervening space), or a base and
end (exclusive) separated by a ",", or a base and maximum (inclusive)
separated by a "-".  All integer values can be in decimal, octal
(leading "0"), hexadecimal (leading "0x"), or binary (leading "0b").

    b[reak]
        List breakpoints.

    b[reak] INTERVAL
        Stop when any instruction whose starting address is in the
        specified interval is about to be executed.

    b[reak] insn INSTRUCTION
        Stop whenever an instruction with the specified mnemonic is
        about to be executed. For example, "break insn rdtsc" will
        cause a stop whenever the specimen tries to read the time
        stamp counter register.

    b[reak] syscall INTERVAL
        Stop whenever a system call is about to be executed where the
        syscall number is present in the specified interval.

    b[reak] fd INTERVAL
        Stop whenever any system call takes a file descriptor whose
        value is present in the specified interval.  This does not
        break for system calls that produce a new file descriptor
        (unless, like dup2, they also operate on that file
        descriptor).

    b[reak] del[ete] ...
        Inserting "delete" after the "break" and before the rest of
        the arguments removes the breakpoints rather than adding them.

    c[ontinue]
        Allow guest to continue executing until some break point is
        reached.

    detach
        Detach the debugger, allowing the guest to execute unimpeded.

    m[emory]
        Print information about the guest's memory segments.

    m[emory] del INTERVAL
        Unmap the specified interval of addresses from the specimen's
        memory address space.

    m[emory] protect MODE [INTERVAL]
        Sets memory protection bits for the specified address
        interval. The MODE are letters "r" (read), "w" (write), "x"
        (execute), or "-" (ignored).  If INTERVAL is missing then all
        of memory is affected.

    m[emory] dump FILE INTERVAL
        Copies simulated memory in the specified INTERVAL to a file
        whose name is given as FILE.  An existing file is
        overwritten.

    m[emory] map RESOURCE
        Copies memory from a file into the guest. The memory map
        resource string has the form
        MEMORY_PROPERTIES:FILE_PROPERTIES:FILE_NAME where
        MEMORY_PROPERTIES and FILE_PROPERTIES are optional but the
        two colons are always required.  The MEMORY_PROPERTIES have
        the form "[ADDRESS][+VSIZE][=ACCESS]" where each of the items
        is optional (indicated by the square brackets which should not
        be present in the actual resource string). The ADDRESS is the
        starting address where the file will be mapped and defaults to
        the address of the lowest unmapped interval that is large
        enough to hold the new map segment; VSIZE is the size in bytes
        of the interval to be mapped, defaulting to the size of the
        file data; and ACCESS is the accessibility represented by zero
        or more of the characters "r" (readable), "w" (writable), and
        "x" (executable) in that order and defaulting to the
        accessibility of the file.  The FILE_PROPERTIES have the form
        "[OFFSET][+FSIZE]" where OFFSET is an offset from the
        beginning of the file defaulting to zero; SIZE is the number
        of bytes to read from the file, defaulting to the amount of
        data that is available. If VSIZE is specified then exactly
        that many bytes are mapped by zero-padding the file data if
        necessary; otherwise, when FSIZE is specified then exactly
        FSIZE bytes are mapped by zero padding the file data that
        could be read; otherwise the file size (adjusted by OFFSET)
        determines the mapped size. The numeric properties can be
        specified in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal using the usual C
        syntax (leading "0x" for hexadecimal, leading "0" for octal,
        otherwise decimal).

    m[emory] hexdump INTERVAL
        Produces a "hexdump -C" style output of the specified memory
        region. It is best to provide an interval that begins on a
        16-byte boundary.

    q[uit]
        Cause the simulator to exit immediately.

    r[egisters]
        Prints the value of all simulator registers.

    r[egister] check
        Reads the following lines, up to a blank line, which
	are the output from GDB's "i r" command and reports
	differences in register values between the simulator
	and GDB.

    r[egister] check fix
        Like "register check" but also updates the simulator's
        registers to be equal to GDB's registers.

    r[egister] NAME
        Prints the value of register whose name is NAME.

    r[egister] NAME VALUE
        Set the named register to have the specified value.

    s[tep] [N]
        Execute at most N (default is 1) instructions or until a break
        point is reached.  The "si" command is an alias since typing
        "s" in GDB can step through many instructions and it's easy to
        get RSIM and GDB commands mixed up when you have two windows
        open side by side.

    x/...
        Similar to the GDB "x/" command, so see GDB's documentation.

== Disassembly issues ==

The simulator disassembles machine instructions only when that memory
is about to be executed the first time, and the instruction is
cached. Self-modifying code will not work correctly with this approach.

== Signal handling ==

Signals delivered to x86sim will be treated as if they were intended
for the specimen (x86sim never gets a SIGSEGV anyway ;-).  After the
OS kernel delivers the signal to x86sim, x86sim will deliver it to the
specimen. This final delivery always happens between instructions.

We don't yet handle signal stacks, although adding one wouldn't be
that hard.

Pressing Control-C won't do what usually happens--it won't immediately
kill x86sim.  Instead, the SIGINT is handled just like the other
signals in that x86sim will deliver it to the specimen.  Usually the
specimen will not have a handler registered for SIGINT and x86sim will
cause the specimen to exit, thus exiting x86sim as well.  If you're
unable to kill x86sim with a Control-C, try Control-\ or, from another
terminal, run "kill -SIGKILL PID" where PID is the process ID of
x86sim (and the specimen).

If x86sim fails an assertion (assert() or ROSE_ASSERT()) it will look
like the specimen failed the assertion since x86sim traps the signal
and delivers it to the specimen. This is true of all signals produced
by x86sim for x86sim.

== Futex issues ==

Fast user-space mutexes (futexes) don't work reliably because
simulator memory operations are not atomic with respect to the real
underlying sys_futex() system call.  The symptom is usually that one
or more threads will become deadlocked when it does a futex_wait
system call when it shouldn't, and therefore there's never a
corresponding futex_wake from another thread.

== Writing programs that use a simulator ==

See x86sim.C and doxygen.
