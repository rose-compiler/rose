ICFG Builder:
1) Support for array initializers
   - currently they are ignored (we would need to generate a list of
     assignments or a special construct accessible in a specification)
2) Support for initialization of global variables
   - currently global variables show up in the ICFG, but the initialization
     in global scope is not accessible. Thus, global variables do not
     have a corresponding DeclStatement

Annotation:
1) Generation of analysis results as pragmas
   - currently only comments are generated
