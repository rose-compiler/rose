# Structure

The `OntoGeneratorInterface.hpp` defines the basic class handling the knowledge generation.
It defines the interface methods by virtual functions.

Specific format support class should subclass it and override the functions.

OntoGeneratorPl is an example of generating database into prolog predicates.
OntoNTriple is to generate into RDF turtles.

`RoseCParser` parses the C code and use an OntoGenerator to export the database.

http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/14362/what-is-difference-bw-turtle-triples-and-n-triples

The Turtle family of languages derives from something called Notation3 that was invented by Tim-Berners Lee. Notation3 provided a compact syntax for writing RDF but also extended RDF by adding features from first-order logic. Thus, Notation3 is a notation for writing "N3 Logic".

N3 Logic turned out to be much slower than RDF, so there hasn't been enduring interest in it.

Turtle is a syntax for RDF that is a subset of Notation3. Turtle has features that enable a concise syntax that is easy to write by hand. You can write something like

  @prefix myns: <http://example.com/mynamespace/>

  myns:object1 a myns:type1,myns:type2;
       myns:property1 myns:object2 .
       
note that the "," lets you give multiple objects that apply to the subject-predicate and the ";" lets you specify different predicates that apply to a subject. There are also some shorthands for blank nodes that are convenient for writing RDF collections and OWL schemas.

N-Triples is a simplified version of Turtle that removes most of the shorthand. One line of an N-Triples equals one triple, so you can process N-Triples files with UNIX tools. N-Triples is more verbose than Turtle, but N-Triples is convenient when you need to handle millions of triples -- gzip compression removes most of the fat. The above file would look like this written in N-Triples:

 <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/object1> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/type1> .
 <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/object1> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/type2> .    
 <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/object1> <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/property1> <http://myexample.com/mynamespace/object2> .

Many of think that Turtle and N-Triples are superior replacements for the obsolete RDF/XML format. Turtle is the preferred format if you want to write a few hundred triples by hand, and N-Triples is used to publish large RDF data sets like DBpedia.
