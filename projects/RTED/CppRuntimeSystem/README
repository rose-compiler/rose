Description of the Runtime system used for the ROSE-RTED support.

Most managers (StackManager, PointerManager, and maybe a few others)
use the MemoryManager.


To support Race Detection, the functions
MemoryManager::checkRead() and MemoryManager::checkWrite()
would have to be modified to keep track of chains of reads and
writes in each thread of execution.  The data structures for the
read/write chains would have to be added (if required, likely
for debugging or providing better information about detected
race conditions).

Note that all pointers are assumed to be of size equal to "void*".
