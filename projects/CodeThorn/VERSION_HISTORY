* Construction of inter-procedural control flow graph:

  - recursive definition: for each AST subtree its corresponding CFG
    is computed. The CFG of an AST subtree is computed from the CFGs
    of its children and the root node of that subtree ('break',
    'return', and scopes are supported).

  - This design is supposed to support transformations (in future
    version) as we will be able to replace sub-CFGs of transformed AST
    subtrees.

* General framework:

  - The general solver is implemented as a work-list algorithm. It
    maintaines all computed system states and determines which states
    have been observed during a computation. Transfer functions do not
    have to be monotone. Only new states are added to the work list
    (otherwise the result has already been computed and is guaranteed
    to be available). After a state has been fetched from the
    work-list its associated transfer function is computed and the
    resulting state(s) are added to the work list.

  - The state maintainer computes a location for the state
    representation and returns a state-id of the state. In subsequent
    computations only the state-id is used.

  - The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because it stores all
    states and checks for existing states. The convergence rate of an
    analysis depends on the domain abstraction and state
    equivalence. Future versions will introduce additional
    meet-operator concepts.

* Interprocedural const-int analysis: 
  - computes system-states for each label in the program a system
    state consists of:
    + label
    + property state (variable mapping for each variable: x->c or x->top)
    + constraint set (supports: x==c,x!=c
                      where x,y are variables and c ist a constant)

* Computation of transition graph: 
  - consists of edges (sstate-id,edge-type,sstate-id)

* Language Restricor:
  - checks that the input program is in the supported C/C++ language subset

* State Maintainer(s): property states and system states are
  maintained by the respective maintainer class. The internal data
  structures are ordered sets.  For all data types used by the
  analyzer a strict weak ordering is defined which is used by the set
  implementation to achieve a logarithmic access time for elements
  [further refined in V1.1]

* Visualization of
  - abstract syntax tree (AST) with computed cfg labels
  - control flow graph
  - transition graph 
  - folded transition graph

V1.1 2012-09-30 Markus Schordan and Adrian Prantl
-------------------------------------------------
new features:

* Linear Time Logic Formulae verification: (Adrian Prantl)
  - input is the state transition graph
  - reads LTL formulae
  - computes (optionally) a reduced transition graph
  - verifies LTL formulae on reduced transition graph using a
    fixed-point algorithm.
  - the algorithm verifies LTL formulae on the approximated cyclic
    transition graphs

* Black-box verification of LTLs: (Adrian Prantl)
  - input/output sequence generator (Haskell prototype)
  - input/output verifyer (providing counter examples)

* Visualization of LTL verification (Adrian Prantl)

* Interprocedural propagation of constraints: (Markus Schordan)
  - directions: caller->callee and callee->caller
  - addition of x=y constraints (restricted to parameter passing)
  - new constraint set operators ensuring that no information is lost
    when x=y constraints are removed

* Extended const-int analysis to const-int-io analysis: (Markus Schordan)
  - added input/output property (none,input,stdcout,stderr,failed-assert)
    to system state.
  - added arithmetic operators: +,-,*,/,%

* Refinement of Maintainer class(es): (Markus Schordan)
  . introduction of hash-sets for maintainer classes 
  - the maintainer class(es) maintain a hash set for each state-class
  - chains of colliding data values in hash sets are organized in 
    ordered sets (as trees with logarithmic access time)  
  - each state-class provides its own hash-function

* Introduction of unique variable-ids (Markus Schordan)
  - computation of ROSE-AST based variable-ids for entire program
  - checks consistency of mapping
  - variable-ids are used in all state representations

* Visualization: (Markus Schordan)
  - all information of the state transition graph can now be also
    viewed in the folded transitino graph (and vice versa). Command
    line options allow to select arbitrary combinations of visualized
    data.
  - extended visualizations with IO operations and failed-asserts

* Several new command line options (all authors)

-------------------------------------------------
V1.2 2012-10-12 Markus Schordan and Adrian Prantl
-------------------------------------------------
new major features:

* Normalized Minimal Constraint sets (Markus Schordan)
  - constraints sets are now normalized

* Parallel analyzer (Markus Schordan)
  - the analyzer can be run in parallel now, supporting multi-core
  systems using OpenMP threads. The number of threads can be specified
  as command line option --threads=<NUM> where NUM is the number of
  threads.

* Several new command line options (all authors)
